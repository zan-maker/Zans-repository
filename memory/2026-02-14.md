## Email Bounce Learnings & Workflow Update

**Bounced Emails Identified:**
- contact@cluely.com - BOUNCED (generic email)
- jeff@apptronik.com - BOUNCED (invalid)

**Updated BOTH Outreach Cron Jobs:**
1. Expense Reduction Outreach (4 PM daily)
2. Wellness 125 Outreach (3 PM daily)

**New Verification Workflow:**
1. Check for generic emails (contact@, info@, support@, etc.) → SKIP
2. Verify with Hunter.io API → Only send if "deliverable"
3. Log all skips with reasons
4. Only use personal emails (firstname@, firstname.lastname@)

**Benefit:** Fewer bounces, better sender reputation, less wasted effort.

## NEW: Deal Origination & Referral Fee System - OFF-MARKET ONLY

**Configured:** Feb 14, 2026
**Updated:** Feb 14, 2026 (Shifted to OFF-MARKET ONLY per Sam's direction)
**Cron Job ID:** 04d10569-06e4-40f5-9eb7-195324535abd
**Schedule:** Daily 1:00 PM EST

### System Overview
**OFF-MARKET ONLY** deal sourcing. Find owners BEFORE they list with brokers.

**Key Principle:** We are NOT brokers. We are off-market deal sourcers.

**CRITICAL UPDATE:**
- ❌ NO broker listings (BizBuySell, Axial, DealStream, etc.)
- ✅ YES Google Maps cluster mining
- ✅ YES Secretary of State filings
- ✅ YES SBA loan payoff data
- ✅ YES Industry association directories
- ✅ YES LinkedIn prospecting
- ✅ YES Permit/license databases
- ✅ YES Equipment financing records

### Daily Targets
- **Sellers:** 10-15 qualified businesses (Segment A or B)
- **PE Buyers:** 3-4 for referral agreements

### Segments
**Segment A:** $500K-$3M EBITDA (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, fire/safety, waste, cleaning, roofing, industrial services)
- Buyers: Independent sponsors, search funds, family offices
- Thesis: Immediate cash flow + operational optimization

**Segment B:** $2M-$10M+ EBITDA (Institutional roll-up targets)
- Buyers: Alpine-style PE, roll-up platforms
- Thesis: Buy-and-build, technology enablement, multiple expansion

### Referral Fee Structure
- 5% up to $1M transaction value
- Sliding scale above $1M
- Minimum fee: $50,000
- Paid at closing (includes deferred + assumed debt)
- 12-month tail protection

**Example Economics:**
- $5M EV deal = ~$150K fee
- $30M EV deal = ~$400K fee
- **Annual Target:** $2M-$3.5M referral revenue

### Off-Market Sourcing Channels (NO BROKERS)
**Sellers (PRIORITY ORDER):**
1. **Google Maps clusters** - Metro areas × industries
2. **Secretary of State filings** - 15+ year old corps
3. **SBA loan payoff data** - Recently debt-free
4. **Industry associations** - ACCA, PHCC, IEC, etc.
5. **LinkedIn prospecting** - Owner-operators 55+
6. **Permit databases** - Active contractors
7. **Equipment financing** - Recent payoffs

**PE Buyers (SAME):** Axial directory, PitchBook, Private Equity Info, PE Hub, family office databases, search fund networks
