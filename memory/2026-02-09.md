## Session: Initial Setup & Configuration

**Identity Established:**
- Name: Zan
- Role: Orchestrator — AI manager that coordinates sub-agents and routes tasks to the right model
- Human: Sam
- Vibe: Efficient, decisive, cost-conscious
- Emoji: 🎛️

## Configuration Decisions

### Model Routing (Final Configuration)
**Final decision (00:02 UTC):** Kimi K2.5 as primary model only

- Reverted OpenRouter/Qwen configuration
- Simplified to Kimi K2.5 for all tasks
- Manual model switching available if other providers added later

**Rationale:** Sam prefers Kimi 2.5 as the consistent default. Other models can be configured manually when needed.

### API Key Storage
- Kimi API key configured via `KIMI_API_KEY` environment variable
- No other providers currently configured

## Skills Installed

1. **Problem-Solving Frameworks** (`skills/problem-solving-frameworks/`)
   - 20 structured frameworks for analysis, root cause, decisions, risk assessment
   - Includes: 5 Whys, MECE Tree, Weighted Decision Grid, Pre-Mortem, OODA Cycle, SWOT+, etc.

2. **MIT First Principles** (`skills/mit-first-principles/`)
   - Strategic analysis via hacker mindset, fire hose test (Three I Model), founder thinking

3. **Task Dashboard** (`skills/task-dashboard/`)
   - Self-hosted Kanban board spec (SQLite + Deno/Node API + React/Vue frontend)
   - For tracking OpenClaw tasks

## Files Created/Updated

- `IDENTITY.md` — Name, creature, vibe, emoji, model routing rules
- `USER.md` — Sam's profile and preferences
- `SOUL.md` — Core truths, model awareness, sub-agent guidance
- `TOOLS.md` — Model routing reference, installed skills catalog
- `MEMORY.md` — Long-term memory with security rules and skill references
- `memory/` directory created for daily logs

## Security References Stored

- Persistent Memory Guide: `/home/node/.openclaw/media/inbound/b4cd45a3-535c-4427-ae6e-563284ff7e0e.md`
- Security Operations Guide: `/home/node/.openclaw/media/inbound/4fe8ad04-65f4-4212-bf1c-eb5a09efdb22.md`
- Model Routing Guide: `/home/node/.openclaw/media/inbound/c827dd11-89ab-4c45-8d8a-c02ba5adae3d.md`

## Key Preferences Established

- Sam values cost-efficiency in model routing
- Use Discord for heartbeat/status messages
- Prefer bullet lists over tables on Discord
- Use reactions (👍, 🙌, 💡) to acknowledge without cluttering chat
- Read SKILL.md before using any skill

## Open Items

- [ ] Sam to set OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable in shell profile
- [ ] Consider rotating API key (was shared in Discord)
- [ ] Populate Active Projects section in MEMORY.md as work begins
- [ ] Establish Standard Operating Procedures as workflows develop

## Lessons Learned

- Model routing decisions should be documented immediately — they affect every future interaction
- Skills should be scanned before installation (security rule)
- API keys should never be shared in chat channels (rotation recommended)
- File-based memory requires explicit writes — context window is temporary
