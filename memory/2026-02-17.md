## What Was Built

### Core Components
- `odds_fetcher.py` - RapidAPI (The Odds API) connector with odds normalization
- `kalshi_connector.py` - Kalshi prediction markets API client
- `arbitrage_scanner.py` - Mispricing detection engine with configurable thresholds
- `main.py` - Orchestrator bot that coordinates all components
- `discover_apis.py` - Tests which RapidAPI sportsbook APIs are accessible

### Documentation
- `README.md` - System architecture overview
- `SETUP.md` - Step-by-step RapidAPI subscription guide
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Fastest path to running live scans

## Technical Details

### Mispricing Detection Logic
```
Sportsbook Implied Probability = 1 / Decimal Odds × 100
Kalshi Implied Probability = Kalshi Price × 100
Mispricing = |Sportsbook% - Kalshi%|
Flag if Mispricing > threshold (default 3%)
```

### API Status
- RapidAPI key provided: c4c3e4c57b...3d5df8
- Status: Valid but NOT SUBSCRIBED to any sportsbook APIs
- Next step: Subscribe to "The Odds API" on RapidAPI (free tier = 500 req/day)

### File Location
All files in: `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/sportsbook-arbitrage/`

## Next Steps (Pending User Action)
1. User needs to subscribe to The Odds API on RapidAPI
2. Run `python3 discover_apis.py` to verify access
3. Run `python3 main.py` to start live arbitrage scanning

## Notes
- System uses urllib (built-in) instead of requests to avoid dependency issues
- Mock data demo works correctly
- Ready for NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, soccer markets
- Kalshi API is public/read-only for market data
