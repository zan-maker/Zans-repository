# Blue Ocean Strategy

**Authors:** Kim & Mauborgne  
**Purpose:** Competitive positioning and market creation. Best strategy isn't beating competitors — it's making them irrelevant.  
**Use when:** Users need competitive analysis, differentiation, market creation, value innovation, positioning, or face crowded markets with margin pressure. Also triggers on: competitive positioning, differentiation, blue ocean, red ocean, stand out, crowded market, commoditized, market creation, value innovation, eliminate, new market space

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Best strategy isn't beating competitors — it's making them irrelevant.**

---

## 🌊 Red vs Blue Ocean

| Red Ocean | Blue Ocean |
|---|---|
| **Compete in existing space** | Create uncontested space |
| **Beat competition** | Make competition irrelevant |
| **Value-cost tradeoff** | Break value-cost tradeoff |
| **Differentiation OR cost** | Differentiation AND cost |

---

## 🧭 Tool 1: Strategy Canvas

**X-axis:** Factors industry competes on  
**Y-axis:** Offering level (H/M/L)

Plot you + competitors. Look for:
- **Convergence** (commodity) — Overinvestment
- **Overinvestment** — Above industry average on both factors
- **Gaps** — Underserved segments
- **Different shapes** — New offering types

**Blue Ocean = Different-shaped curve,** not higher on same factors.

## 🛠️ Tool 2: Four Actions (ERRC)

**Every factor is a lever you can pull. Power = combination:**

### ELIMINATE
**Factors taken for granted to remove entirely**

| Factor | Action | Throughput gain |
|---|---|---|
| Eliminate features customers don't use | Simplify | Faster dev, lower cost |
| Eliminate service levels customers don't need | Standardize | Lower overhead |
| Remove performance tiers not valued | Streamline | Reduce complexity |

### REDUCE
**Drop well below standard where customers won't pay**

| Factor | Action | Throughput gain |
|---|---|---|
| Reduce performance to "good enough" | Lower cost | 20% cost savings |
| Eliminate premium features | Lower price | 15% cost savings |
| Simplify packaging | Reduce waste | 5% cost savings |

### CREATE
**New factors never offered**

| Factor | Action | Throughput gain |
|---|---|---|
| Add new feature never offered | Premium pricing | 10% margin lift |
| New delivery model | Convenience | Customer lock-in |
| New business model | Revenue stream | New market |

**Power = Eliminate (E/R) while Increase (R/C)**

### RAISE
**Increase above standard where buyers compromise**

| Factor | Action | Throughput gain |
|---|---|---|
| Superior performance | Premium pricing | 15% margin lift |
| Better materials | Quality perception | 10% margin lift |
| Better design | Aesthetics | 5% margin lift |

## 🎯 Tool 3: Buyer Utility Map

**Each cell = potential opportunity.**

**Stages:**
| Purchase | Delivery | Use | Supplements | Maintenance | Disposal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Productivity | Simplicity | Convenience | Risk | Fun | Environmental |
| Cost | Speed | Customization | Support | Durability | Recycling |

**Levers:**
- Productivity: speed, ease
- Cost: price, financing
- Risk: reliability, safety
- Fun: enjoyment, status
- Environmental: sustainability, ethics

**Ignored cells = best opportunities** (competitors aren't serving).

## 🏔️ Tool 4: Three Tiers of Non-Customers

**Different levels of "won't buy from us"**

### Tier 1: On the edge
**Why minimal?** What caused rejection?
- Too expensive? (Tier 2 offers same, cheaper)
- Too complex? (Buying process confusing)
- Wrong capabilities? (Overqualified)

**Action:** Understand and remove barriers.

### Tier 2: Consciously refused
**What caused rejection?**
- Not familiar with company
- Preferred known vendor
- Timing wasn't right
- Budget constraints

**Action:** What would change this decision?

### Tier 3: Never considered
**Why weren't they in your market?**
- No awareness
- Wrong channel
- Assumed wrong capabilities
- Self-excluded from consideration

**Action:** Reach out and test assumptions.

## 🎯 How to Use

**Start with red ocean symptoms:**
- Margin pressure
- Commoditization
- Price competition
- Multiple competitors with similar offerings

**Apply tools in sequence:**
1. Canvas — visualize competition
2. ERRC — find levers
3. Buyer Utility — find opportunities
4. Three Tiers — understand non-customers
5. Create new curve

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Make competition irrelevant, not better** — Differentiate to create new market
- **Break value-cost tradeoff** — Value innovation
- **Non-customers are your best source of ideas** — Why they won't buy from you
- **Blue Ocean = Different shape, NOT higher factors** — Don't play on their terms

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Me-too differentiation** — Competing on same curve with slight improvement
2. **Value = "more stuff"** — Adding features customers won't pay for
3. **Ignoring non-customers** — Missing low-hanging fruit
4. **Premium pricing without differentiation** — Premium must be defensible
5. **Niche = small** — Blue ocean still needs scale for sustainable advantage
