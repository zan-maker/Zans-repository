MIT-inspired first principles thinking framework for strategic analysis and problem decomposition. Use when users face complex problems requiring deep system understanding, need to prioritize competing demands, want to challenge assumptions, or seek breakthrough solutions. Triggers on requests for strategic analysis, prioritization frameworks, assumption testing, problem decomposition, or when facing "impossible" workloads. Applies hacker mindset (master the system), fire hose test (ruthless prioritization), and founder thinking (first principles decomposition).MIT First Principles Framework
Three interconnected principles for attacking complex problems.
Principle 1: Master the System (Hacker Mindset)
Core insight: Understand underlying logic deeply before attempting to change or fight it.
Before brute-forcing any solution:

Map the system's constraints, dependencies, and leverage points
Identify which rules are true constraints vs. inherited assumptions
Find the "curvature of the dome" — precise understanding enables creative solutions

Application questions:

What is the actual mechanic driving this system?
Where are the joints and seams where intervention is possible?
What would a playful expert do that a stressed novice wouldn't see?

Principle 2: Fire Hose Test (Ruthless Prioritization)
Core insight: The overwhelming flood is never meant to be consumed whole. The test is learning to focus.
Three I Model — Apply Before Any Commitment

Passing the test means: Choosing between valuable and more valuable, not good vs. bad.
Principle 3: Founder Thinking (First Principles Decomposition)
Core insight: Breakthroughs come from questioning what you assume, not accepting inherited constraints.
Decomposition Framework
1. STATE the problem in 1-2 lines
2. SPLIT into three columns:

   FACTS              | ASSUMPTIONS           | NEXT STEP
   (What I know)      | (What I'm accepting)  | (How to test)
   -------------------|----------------------|------------------
   [verified data]    | [inherited belief]   | [smallest experiment]

3. PICK one assumption → test this week
The Musk test: When SpaceX found rockets "cost" $65M, first principles showed raw materials were ~2% of that. The 98% was assumption.

Quick Reference
Hacker question: "What would someone who truly understood this system do differently?"
Fire hose question: "If I could only do one thing from this list, which moves the needle?"
Founder question: "What am I assuming that might be wrong?"
