20 structured problem-solving and decision-making frameworks for strategic analysis, root cause diagnosis, option evaluation, and risk assessment. Use when users need to analyze complex problems, compare options, validate assumptions, anticipate failures, generate ideas, or make decisions under uncertainty. Triggers include requests for frameworks, structured analysis, decision support, strategic planning, root cause analysis, risk assessment, option comparison, or any ambiguous business problem requiring systematic decomposition.Problem-Solving Frameworks
Apply these frameworks to decompose complex problems, evaluate options, and drive decisions. Select framework based on problem type.

Usage Notes
When applying frameworks, adapt the template to context rather than filling every cell mechanically. Combine frameworks when problems span multiple dimensions (e.g., MECE Issue Tree → Weighted Decision Grid for prioritization).
For strategic decisions, default to: Pre-Mortem + Counterfactual Lens + Weighted Decision Grid.
For operational problems, default to: Root Cause 5 Whys + MECE Issue Tree + Force-Field Dynamics.
