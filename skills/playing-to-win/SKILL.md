# Playing to Win Strategy Cascade

**Authors:** Lafley and Martin  
**Purpose:** Build strategy as an integrated set of choices that positions you to win. Each box constrains and enables the next.  
**Use when:** Users build strategy, define competitive positioning, create strategy documents or board decks, choose markets or segments, articulate advantage, or align capabilities to strategy

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Strategy = integrated set of choices that positions you to win.** Each choice (box) both constrains and enables.

---

## 📦 The Five Choices

### Choice 1: Winning Aspiration

**What does winning look like?** Not a vague mission — a specific success picture. Who benefits? How?

**Examples:**
- Vague: "Build a great business"
- Specific: "Own the mid-market CRM segment with 30% market share by 2028"

### Choice 2: Where to Play

**NARROWING, not expanding:**

- Geography (Country, region, city)
- Customer segments (Products/Services)
- Channels (Direct, indirect, online)
- Value chain stage (Raw materials, components, finished goods)
- Product/Service variants

**Where NOT to play:** Equally important. Don't try to be everything to everyone.

### Choice 3: How to Win

**Two fundamental strategies (choose one as primary):**

| Strategy | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cost Leadership** | Comparable value at lower cost |
| **Differentiation** | Unique value worth a premium |

**Differentiation types:**
- Product (features, performance)
- Service (experience, support)
- Channel (access, convenience)
- Image/Brand (reputation, trust)

**Test for differentiation:**
- Would a customer pay more for this? If no → cost play
- Would switching costs make this defensible? If yes → differentiation

### Choice 4: Capabilities Required

**Reinforcing set needed for Where + How to Win:**

| | [Capability 1] | [Capability 2] | [Capability 3] |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Status:** | Have | Building | Need |
| **Reinforces:** | [other choices] | [other choices] | [other choices] |

**Power = SYSTEM of capabilities** (competitors copy one; copying integrated system is hard)

| Must-have vs Nice-to-have | Have today or need to build? |
|---|---|
| **Must-have** | Required to compete at all |
| **Nice-to-have** | Competitive advantage, but not required |

### Choice 5: Management Systems

**Systems, structures, measures to support strategy:**

| | Metrics | Structure | Processes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What to measure** | Org structure | Enabling processes |
| **Reinforcing** | Culture | |

---

## ✅ Integration Test

**Each box constrains AND enables the others.**

**Reverse test:** "We aspire to [1]. We play in [2] and win by [3]. This requires [4], supported by [5]." Any gap = incomplete.

**Forward test:** Every box constrains AND enables. If changing one box doesn't affect others, it's a list not strategy.

## 🎯 Probing Questions

### Winning Aspiration
- What does winning look like? Who benefits? How?

### Where to Play
- Which markets/segments will we dominate?
- Where are we NOT playing?

### How to Win
- Cost leadership OR differentiation?
- Which differentiation type (product, service, channel, image)?
- Would customers pay a premium for this?

### Capabilities Required
- Must-have vs nice-to-have?
- What do we have that competitors lack?
- What must we build?

### Management Systems
- What do we measure?
- Does structure support strategy?
- Do processes reinforce culture?

### Sources of Power

| | Leverage | Proximate Objectives |
|---|---|---|
| [Source] | [Goal it enables] |
| [Source] | [Goal it enables] |
| | | **Focus: concentrating resources on a narrowed front** |

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Five choices = strategy cascade** — Each enables the next
- **Narrowing is essential** — Don't try to be everything
- **Capabilities = system power** — Integration is hard to copy
- **Must-haves vs nice-to-haves** — Build for the win, not everything

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Broad aspiration** — "Transform our industry" (too vague)
2. **Playing everywhere** — Trying to serve all segments
3. **No clear how to win** — Differentiation is buzzword-only
4. **Aspirational capabilities** — Wishing isn't having
5. **No integration** — Five independent boxes, not a system
