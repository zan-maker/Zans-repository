# Good Strategy Bad Strategy

**Author:** Richard Rumelt  
**Purpose:** Evaluate and formulate strategy using the "kernel" framework (Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, Coherent Actions). Real strategy has three parts that form a coherent whole.  
**Use when:** Users need to evaluate whether a strategy is real or fluff, formulate a strategy from a messy situation, critique a strategic plan, write a strategy document, prepare a board deck with strategic framing, or distinguish between goals and actual strategy

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Most strategies are just goals, wishlists, or slogans.** Real strategy has three parts that form a coherent whole:
1. Diagnosis
2. Guiding Policy
3. Coherent Actions

## 🏗️ The Strategy Kernel

### Part 1: Diagnosis

**What's going on here? Clear, honest statement of the challenge.** Simplifies reality by identifying critical factors.

**Probing questions:**
- What is the single most critical challenge?
- What makes this hard?
- What have we been ignoring?
- Which one problem unlocks the rest?

### Part 2: Guiding Policy

**What's our approach? NOT a goal — a method.** Channels action by ruling things out. Creates advantage through focus.

**Probing questions:**
- Does this rule things out?
- Does this explain HOW?
- Would a competitor choose differently?
- Does this create focus or please everyone?

### Part 3: Coherent Actions

**What specifically will we do?** Coordinated, feasible actions that reinforce each other. Resource allocation must match.

**Probing questions:**
- Do actions reinforce each other?
- Are they feasible given actual capabilities?
- Do they follow from the guiding policy?
- What must we STOP doing?

## 🚨 Bad Strategy Detection

**Flag any of these four hallmarks:**

### Fluff
- Buzzword inflation that says nothing
- Failure to face the challenge
- Mistaking goals for strategy — Goals without HOW
- Bad strategic objectives — Disconnected wishlists, no prioritization

### The Trap: Mistaking Goals for Strategy

| Goal | NOT Strategy |
|---|-----------|
| "Double revenue" | Missing: customer acquisition, pricing, product |
| "Enter new market" | Missing: differentiation, entry strategy |
| "Best-in-class customer service" | Missing: which segments, what trade-offs |

**Good strategic objectives** are SMART and flow from kernel.

## 🎲 Execution Modes

### Mode 1: Strategy Evaluation

1. Extract the kernel (often one or more elements are missing)
2. Apply bad strategy tests
3. Score each element on: specificity, honesty, coherence
4. Deliver verdict directly — if bad, say so and offer to reformulate

### Mode 2: Strategy Formulation

1. **Start with diagnosis** — probe for the real challenge (most time here)
2. Derive guiding policy — test against "does this rule things out?"
3. Design coherent actions — check resource conflicts, mutual reinforcement
4. **Stress test through bad strategy detector**

### Mode 3: Strategy-on-a-Page

**STRATEGY KERNEL**

**DIAGNOSIS** (2-3 sentences naming the core challenge)

**GUIDING POLICY** (1-2 sentences: what we will and won't do)

**COHERENT ACTIONS**
1. [Action] — [How it supports the guiding policy]
2. [Action] — [How it supports the guiding policy]
3. [Action] — [How it supports the guiding policy]

**WHAT WE'RE STOPPING**
- [Activity conflicting with the guiding policy]

**Slide 4: Sources of Power**

| | Leverage | Proximate Objectives |
|---|---|---|
| [Source] | [Goal it enables] |
| [Source] | [Goal it enables] |
| [Source] | [Goal it enables] |
| | | **Chain-link systems** |
| | **Design: tight integration where whole > parts** |

**Slide 5: Competitive Advantage**

| Primary: | [Primary strategy type: Cost/Differentiation] |
| Defense: | [How defend] |

## 🎯 Probing Questions

### Diagnosis
- What is the single most critical challenge?
- What makes this hard?
- What have we been ignoring?
- Which one problem unlocks the rest?

### Guiding Policy
- Does this rule things out?
- Does this explain HOW?
- Would a competitor choose differently?
- Does this create focus or please everyone?

### Coherent Actions
- Do actions reinforce each other?
- Are they feasible given actual capabilities?
- Do they follow from the guiding policy?
- What must we STOP doing?

### Sources of Power

- Leverage: effort where it has greatest effect
- Proximate objectives: achievable goals that clear the fog
- Chain-link systems: performance limited by weakest link
- Design: tight integration where whole exceeds parts
- Focus: concentrating resources on a narrowed front
- Dynamics: riding waves of change

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Strategy ≠ Goals** — Goals are destinations; strategy is the path
- **Good strategy is coherent** — all three parts align
- **Bad strategy is incoherent** — actions conflict or lack connection
- **Focus requires sacrifice** — you can't do everything

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Strategy as slogan** — "Be customer-obsessed" with no differentiation
2. **Incoherent actions** — Marketing says X, engineering builds Y
3. **No trade-offs** — Trying to win on every dimension
4. **Mistaking activities for strategy** — "We'll do sales calls and product development and partnerships"
5. **No constraints** — Strategy ignores budget, time, or capability limits
