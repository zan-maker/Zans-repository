# Kalshi High Risk/Reward Opportunities - Analysis Report

**Date**: 2026-02-18  
**Scan Type**: NO Contract Opportunities (Low Probability, High Payout)  
**Strategy**: Find cheap NO contracts (≤15¢) on unlikely events with clear catalysts

---

## Current Market Structure Issue

**Problem**: Kalshi API is primarily returning MVE (Multi-Variable Event) markets - these are parlay-style contracts with complex pricing, NOT standard binary YES/NO markets like the examples you provided.

**Example Markets Found**:
- Multi-game parlays ("yes Kawhi Leonard: 1+, yes Kevin Durant: 1+...")
- Complex conditional markets
- These show NO @ 100¢ (untradeable) or YES @ 0-29¢

**What We Need**: Standard binary markets like:
- "Will Anthropic IPO before OpenAI?" → NO @ 3-4¢
- "Will unemployment exceed 10% in 2025?" → NO @ 2-3¢

## Recommended Search Strategy

### 1. Direct Kalshi Website Search
Go to **kalshi.com** and search these categories for cheap NO contracts:

**Economic Indicators** (Your "Unemployment" Style Play):
- Search: "unemployment", "recession", "inflation", "GDP", "rates"
- Look for: NO contracts priced 2-8¢ on extreme outcomes
- Target: Events with <10% probability but priced at 20-30¢ (edge)

**Tech/IPO Markets** (Your "Anthropic" Style Play):
- Search: "IPO", "SPAC", "listing", "Anthropic", "OpenAI", "Stripe", "SpaceX"
- Look for: NO on unlikely IPOs at 2-5¢
- Thesis: Companies with no IPO pressure vs those that need liquidity

**Political/Policy**:
- Search: "Trump", "Biden", "Congress", "shutdown", "impeachment"
- Look for: NO on extreme scenarios at 1-5¢

**Geopolitical**:
- Search: "war", "conflict", "sanctions", "election"
- Look for: NO on unlikely escalations at 2-6¢

## Similar Opportunities to Your Examples

Based on your thesis style, here are the **types** of trades to hunt for:

### Type A: IPO Timing Arbitrage (Like Anthropic vs OpenAI)

**What to Look For**:
- Two comparable companies, one with IPO pressure, one without
- Buy NO on the one WITHOUT IPO pressure (cheap)
- Thesis: The pressured company will IPO first

**Candidates**:
- **Stripe vs Plaid**: Stripe has more investor pressure ($65B valuation, late-stage)
  - Trade: NO on "Plaid IPOs first" @ 2-4¢
  
- **SpaceX vs Starlink**: SpaceX has more pressure (Starlink may never IPO separately)
  - Trade: NO on "Starlink IPOs first" @ 1-3¢

- **Databricks vs Snowflake**: Snowflake already public, Databricks next
  - Look for markets comparing IPO timing

### Type B: Extreme Economic Outcomes (Like Unemployment >10%)

**What to Look For**:
- 2-3 sigma events priced at 10-20¢ when true probability is 2-5%
- Buy NO at 2-5¢, collect 95-98¢ when it doesn't happen

**Candidates**:
- **US enters recession 2025**: If YES at 30-40¢, NO should be 60-70¢
  - Look for mispricing where NO is trading 80-90¢ (buy)
  
- **Fed rates >6% by end 2025**: Extreme scenario
  - If YES priced at 15¢, NO should be 85¢
  - Look for NO at 90-95¢ (buy for 5-10¢ profit)

- **CPI >5% in 2025**: Unlikely with current trends
  - Look for NO at cheap prices

### Type C: Political Extreme Scenarios

**What to Look For**:
- Impeachment, removal, extreme policy changes
- Buy NO at 1-5¢ on unlikely outcomes

**Candidates**:
- "Trump removed from office 2025" - NO @ 2-3¢
- "Biden resigns 2025" - NO @ 1-2¢
- "Government shutdown >30 days" - NO @ 3-5¢

## Risk/Reward Framework

| Risk Level | NO Price | Max Profit | Reward Ratio | Position Size |
|------------|----------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 🟢 Conservative | 5-8¢ | 92-95¢ | 11-19x | 50 contracts |
| 🟡 Moderate | 10-15¢ | 85-90¢ | 5.7-9x | 30 contracts |
| 🔴 Aggressive | 20-30¢ | 70-80¢ | 2.3-4x | 20 contracts |

**Your Examples**:
- Anthropic NO @ 3-4¢ = 24-32x reward (aggressive)
- Unemployment NO @ 2-3¢ = 32-48x reward (very aggressive)

## Action Plan

### Immediate Steps:

1. **Go to kalshi.com directly**
   - API is showing MVE markets only
   - Website has standard binary markets

2. **Search these exact terms**:
   ```
   "IPO 2025" - Look for timing comparison markets
   "unemployment" - Find monthly/quarterly thresholds
   "recession" - Find 2025 definition markets
   "shutdown" - Government funding deadlines
   "rates" - Fed funds rate targets
   ```

3. **Filter for**:
   - Markets closing within 90 days
   - Volume >$50K
   - NO price 2-15¢
   - Clear, measurable outcome

4. **Calculate Edge**:
   - True probability estimate
   - Kalshi implied probability (100 - NO price)
   - Edge = True% - Implied%
   - Only trade if edge >5%

## Specific Markets to Hunt (Estimated)
