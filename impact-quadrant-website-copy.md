## Supporting Visual Description
> **Animated visualization concept:** 
> A central dashboard showing Netsuite/ERP interface with 4-5 animated "agent" orbs (different colors) orbiting and interacting with financial data. Each agent pulses when active, showing real-time processing. Data flows from chaos (disconnected spreadsheets) to clarity (unified dashboard). Subtle particle effects suggest AI intelligence at work.

## Social Proof Element
```
Trusted by 30+ growth-stage companies
from $5M to $100M ARR

# SECTION 2: PROBLEM / SOLUTION

---

## PROBLEM SIDE

### Section Header
```
Your ERP Was Built for Records.
You Need It for Decisions.
```

### Pain Points

**1. You're Flying Blind on Cash Flow**
```
Netsuite tells you what happened last month. 
You need to know what happens next week.
Legacy reporting is too slow for fast-moving companies.
```

**2. Month-End Takes 15 Days (It Should Take 3)**
```
Your team is stuck reconciling data instead of analyzing it.
Manual processes create errors that compound every cycle.
```

**3. Board Decks Eat Your Weekends**
```
Pulling metrics from 12 different sources isn't strategy—
it's data archaeology. You're working for the tools 
instead of the other way around.
```

**4. Growth Is Outpacing Your Finance Function**
```
Every new product line, every geography, every acquisition
adds complexity your current setup can't handle.
```

### Supporting Stats
```
📊 73% of CFOs say their team spends more time 
    gathering data than analyzing it (McKinsey)

📊 Growth-stage companies waste 200+ hours/month 
    on manual financial processes

📊 Average time to close: 6.4 days for best-in-class, 
    15+ days for everyone else
```

### Visual Concept
> **Interactive comparison slider:**
> Left side shows "The Old Way" - cluttered desktop with 15 open tabs, Excel crashing, sticky notes, frustrated person at 11 PM. Right side shows "The Agent Way" - clean interface, single dashboard, one person leaving at 5 PM. User can drag slider to reveal transformation.

### Transition to Agent Showcase
```
Here's who does the heavy lifting:
```

---

### Section Header
```
Your Digital Finance Team
```

### Section Intro

---

## TEAM ORCHESTRATION

### Concept Header
```
They Don't Just Work. They Work Together.
```

### Description
```
Your agents aren't isolated tools—they're a coordinated team.

When Forecaster spots a cash gap, Advisor suggests which 
outstanding invoices to prioritize. When Reconciler finds 
an anomaly, Watchdog checks if it's a one-off or a pattern. 
Reporter pulls insights from all agents to tell the complete 
story in your board deck.

And your fractional CFO? They're the conductor—setting 
priorities, reviewing recommendations, and making the 
calls that require human judgment.
```

### Visual Concept
> **Animated workflow diagram:**
> Shows agents as nodes in a network, with data flowing between them. Highlight example: An invoice enters → Reconciler processes it → Forecaster updates cash position → Advisor flags it for early payment discount → Watchdog verifies approval limits → Reporter includes it in weekly summary. All flowing in real-time.
