```
Hi [Name],

Given [Firm Name]'s experience in [hospitality/restaurants/operations], I wanted to share an investment opportunity in the wellness hospitality space.

• Farm-to-table restaurants (2 five-star venues)
• Membership-based recurring revenue
• 300ft waterfall, organic farming, equestrian trails

Unlike traditional hospitality, Dorada drives repeat engagement through personalized health programs—a "lifetime engagement model" vs. one-time destination.

Key metrics:
• Market: $2.1T wellness economy by 2030 (12.4% CAGR)
• Founder: Dr. Vincent Giampapa (longevity medicine authority)
• Asset: 300-acre protected bio-reserve with panoramic ocean views
