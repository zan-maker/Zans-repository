## DAY 3 FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TEMPLATES (Ready to Send)

### Follow-up #1: 512 Asset Management (Real Estate Focus)
**To:** scott@reissa.org  
**CC:** sam@impactquadrant.info  
**Subject:** Re: Costa Rica Blue Zone Luxury Real Estate - Investment Opportunity

```
Hi Jordan,

I wanted to follow up on my email from Tuesday regarding the Dorada luxury real estate investment opportunity in Costa Rica's Blue Zone.

Given 512 Asset Management's focus on real estate development projects, I thought this might be a compelling fit for your portfolio:

• 300-acre protected bio-reserve with panoramic ocean views
• 40 private ocean-view estate homes (1+ acre each)
• Luxury eco-hotel + branded hillside residences
• Longevity & Human Performance Center (high-margin recurring revenue)
• Fully off-grid sustainable infrastructure

The project is led by Dr. Vincent Giampapa, a pioneer in anti-aging medicine, which differentiates this from typical resort developments—it's a science-driven longevity ecosystem.

Worth a 15-minute call to explore if this aligns with your investment criteria?

Best,
Zan

### Follow-up #2: 13th Floor Capital (Hospitality Focus)
**To:** mrudman@13fc.com  
**CC:** sam@impactquadrant.info  
**Subject:** Re: Hospitality Investment - Wellness Resort with Recurring Revenue Model

```
Hi Michael,

Following up on my Tuesday email about the Dorada wellness hospitality investment opportunity in Costa Rica.

Given 13th Floor Capital's expertise in multi-unit hospitality operations, this could be particularly interesting:

The Asset:
• 40 estate homes + luxury eco-hotel (300-acre Blue Zone location)
• Two five-star farm-to-table restaurants
• Longevity & Human Performance Center (membership/recurring revenue model)
• 300ft waterfall, organic farming, equestrian trails

Why It Differs from Traditional Hospitality:
Unlike typical resorts, Dorada drives repeat engagement through personalized health programs—a "lifetime customer" model vs. one-time destination stays. The longevity center creates high-margin recurring revenue streams.

Operations Expertise Opportunity:
The F&B and hospitality components could benefit from experienced operators. Your background in restaurant multi-unit operations seems highly relevant.

Would you be open to a brief call this week or next?

Best,
Zan

Hi [Name],

Thank you for connecting. I wanted to follow up on the Dorada investment opportunity I mentioned in my connection request.

Dorada is a regenerative destination resort in Costa Rica's Blue Zone—combining luxury real estate (40 ocean-view estate homes), hospitality, and a science-driven Longevity & Human Performance Center led by Dr. Vincent Giampapa (anti-aging medicine pioneer).

Given Accurent's focus on hospitality and commercial real estate, this could be a compelling opportunity. The project sits at the intersection of the $2.1T wellness economy and hard asset real estate.

Would you be interested in seeing a brief investment summary? Happy to send details or schedule a quick call.

Best,
Zan

## DAY 4 EMAIL TEMPLATES (SENT - Friday, Feb 20, 2026)

### Email #1: 1875 Finance SA (International Real Estate Focus)
**To:** mcorga@1875.ch  
**CC:** sam@impactquadrant.info  
**Subject:** Costa Rica Blue Zone Real Estate - Geographic Diversification Opportunity

```
Hi Michael,

I'm reaching out regarding a unique luxury real estate investment opportunity in Costa Rica's Blue Zone that may align with 1875 Finance's real estate allocation strategy.

Dorada is a 300-acre regenerative destination resort featuring:

• 40 private ocean-view estate homes (1+ acre each)
• Luxury eco-hotel with branded hillside residences  
• Longevity & Human Performance Center (recurring revenue model)
• Fully off-grid sustainable power, water, and security
• Blue Zone location (one of 5 global longevity hotspots)

For a Swiss-based multi-family office, this offers:
- Geographic diversification outside European markets
- Hard asset real estate with lifestyle value
- Exposure to the $2.1T wellness economy (12.4% CAGR)
- Founder: Dr. Vincent Giampapa, globally recognized anti-aging medicine pioneer

The project combines wealth preservation characteristics with experiential value—a rare convergence for family office portfolios.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how this might fit 1875's investment criteria?

Best regards,
Zan

### Email #2: 2M Investment Partners (Operator/Active Investment Focus)
**To:** fields@2minvestors.com  
**CC:** sam@impactquadrant.info  
**Subject:** Active Investment Opportunity - Wellness Resort with Operations Component

```
Hi Michael,

Given 2M Investment Partners' "own and operate" approach to concentrated portfolio companies, I wanted to share an investment opportunity that combines real assets with active operational upside.

Dorada (Costa Rica Blue Zone) is seeking investment partners for a regenerative destination resort:

The Asset:
• 300-acre protected bio-reserve with panoramic ocean views
• 40 private estate homes + luxury eco-hotel
• Two five-star farm-to-table restaurants
• Longevity & Human Performance Center (high-margin services)
• Equestrian facilities, organic farming, 300ft waterfall

The Opportunity:
Unlike passive real estate, Dorada offers operational engagement through:
- Hospitality & F&B operations (2 restaurants, hotel, events)
- Longevity center service delivery (membership/recurring model)
- Potential for value-add operational improvements

This aligns with 2M's focus on businesses where operational expertise drives returns—not just financial engineering.

Founder Dr. Vincent Giampapa (anti-aging medicine pioneer) brings scientific credibility, while the Blue Zone location provides rare market positioning.

Worth exploring if this fits your $5-50M revenue target and operational investment thesis?

Best,
Zan
