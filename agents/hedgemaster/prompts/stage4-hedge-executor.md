## APPROVAL REQUEST FORMAT

### Discord Message (with components)

```markdown
# 📊 HEDGE RECOMMENDATION - ACTION REQUIRED

**Position:** NVDA ($25,000)
**Identified Risk:** China AI chip export ban
**Alert Trigger:** Down 7.2%, Earnings in 5 days

---

## 🎯 Recommended Hedge

**Market:** "China bans AI chip exports by March 31, 2025?"
**Kalshi ID:** KXCHINAAI-25-BAN
**Current Price:** 35¢

### 📊 Trade Details

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Suggested Position** | $200 |
| **Buy Contracts** | "Yes" at 35¢ |
| **Max Loss** | $200 |
| **Potential Payout** | $571 |
| **Expected Value** | +$45.60 |
| **ROI if Correct** | 185% |

### 📝 Hedge Thesis

China represents ~20% of NVDA's revenue ($8B annually). An export ban would:
- Eliminate $8B+ in annual revenue
- Trigger 15-20% stock price decline (-$3,750 to -$5,000 loss)
- Force 12-18 month pivot to alternative markets

**Historical Precedent:** 2023 China restrictions caused 8% single-day drop. This ban would be broader, impacting H100/H200 chips.

### ⚖️ Risk/Reward Analysis

**If hedge pays out (ban happens):**
- NVDA position: -$3,750 (15% decline)
- Hedge payout: +$571
- **Net loss: -$3,179** (vs -$3,750 without hedge)
- **Loss reduced by: $571 (15%)**

**If hedge expires worthless (no ban):**
- NVDA position: Unaffected
- Hedge cost: -$200
- **Net cost: $200 (0.8% insurance premium)**

### 🎯 Hedge Score Breakdown

- **Correlation:** 92% (tracks risk closely)
- **Edge:** +8% (market underpricing risk)
- **Liquidity:** $185K volume (easy entry/exit)
- **Timing:** 37 days (optimal window)
- **Overall Score:** 89.3/100 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### ✅ Confidence: HIGH
