Subject: Business for sale - $3-5M EBITDA [Industry]

Hi Remington,

I'm working with a profitable manufacturing business in Southeast US generating $3.5M EBITDA with strong recurring revenue.

The owners are looking for a strategic partner to support their next growth phase, and given Audax Group's focus on lower middle market investments, this might align well with your strategy.

Key highlights:
• $3.5M EBITDA, 25% margins
• 15+ year track record
• Recurring revenue model
• Growth runway with capital

Worth a brief call to discuss?

Best regards,
Sam
