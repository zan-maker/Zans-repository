## EMAIL TEMPLATE 1: Initial Introduction
**Subject:** Off-market business opportunities - Referral partnership

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I came across {{Company}} and see you're actively acquiring lower middle market businesses in the {{Region}} region.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities—businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces. These are owner-direct situations where we can avoid auction processes and competitive bidding.

WHAT I OFFER:
• Direct relationships with business owners
• Pre-qualified sellers ($1M-$10M EBITDA range)
• No broker intermediaries = better economics
• Focus on HVAC, plumbing, electrical, car washes, and blue-collar services

CURRENT PIPELINE EXAMPLES:
• HVAC contractor in Texas ($3.2M EBITDA, 25 years in operation)
• Car wash portfolio in Florida (4 locations, $2.8M EBITDA)
• Plumbing services company in Georgia ($1.8M EBITDA, recurring commercial contracts)

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (typically 5% of transaction value, minimum $50K).

Worth a brief 15-minute call this week or next?

Best regards,
Zane

P.S. I can share detailed business summaries if any of the above fit your criteria.

## EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: Follow-Up with Social Proof
**Subject:** RE: Off-market business opportunities

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Following up on my note from earlier this week about off-market deal flow.

I wanted to share a recent win: I just connected a PE buyer with a commercial cleaning business in Atlanta:
• $2.1M EBITDA
• 18-year track record
• Owner retiring, no broker involved
• LOI signed within 30 days of introduction

The buyer avoided a competitive auction and got exclusive access at a better valuation.

MY CURRENT ACTIVE PIPELINE:
• 4 HVAC businesses (TX, FL, GA) - $1.5M-$4M EBITDA
• 2 Car wash operations (metro areas) - $800K-$2M EBITDA
• 3 Plumbing/electrical contractors (various markets) - $1M-$3M EBITDA
• 2 Manufacturing businesses (Southeast) - $2M-$5M EBITDA

All are off-market, owner-direct, and motivated.

If {{Company}} is open to receiving these opportunities, I'd love to set up a brief call to discuss how we can work together.

Best regards,
Zane

## EMAIL TEMPLATE 3: Referral Agreement Terms
**Subject:** Referral agreement terms - {{Company}}

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Since I haven't heard back, I wanted to be specific about what a referral partnership looks like:

STANDARD TERMS:
• Referral fee: 5% of transaction value up to $1M
• Sliding scale above $1M (typically 3-4%)
• Minimum fee: $50,000
• Paid at closing (includes deferred consideration + assumed debt)
• Attribution: 12-month tail from introduction
• Exclusivity: None—you can work with other sources too

WHAT YOU GET:
• First look at off-market opportunities
• Direct owner contact (no intermediaries)
• Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
• Detailed business summaries before introduction
• Confidentiality maintained throughout

EXAMPLE ECONOMICS:
$3M EBITDA business @ 4x multiple = $12M EV
Referral fee = $600K (5% of first $10M + 3% of remaining $2M)

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
• Investment criteria (industries, size, geography)
• Ideal deal profile and check size range
• Decision timeline for new opportunities

I'm currently working with 12 sellers actively seeking buyers. If any fit your criteria, I can make an introduction immediately.

Can we schedule 15 minutes to discuss?

Best regards,
Zane

## EMAIL TEMPLATE 4: Final Attempt with Pipeline
**Subject:** One last note - off-market deal flow

Hi {{FirstName}},

I'll keep this brief as I know you're evaluating many opportunities.

I have 3 qualified sellers in active discussions that may fit {{Company}}'s criteria:

1. HVAC CONTRACTOR - TEXAS
   $4.2M EBITDA | 30 years in business | Owner retiring
   6 locations, strong recurring commercial contracts

2. CAR WASH PORTFOLIO - FLORIDA
   $2.8M EBITDA combined | 4 locations | Fully staffed
   Owner relocating, motivated seller

3. ELECTRICAL SERVICES - GEORGIA
   $1.9M EBITDA | 22 years | Government contracts
   Second-generation owner, no succession plan

All are off-market, owner-direct, and ready for serious conversations.

If {{Company}} is interested in seeing detailed summaries, simply reply "SEND DETAILS" and I'll forward everything.

If now isn't the right time, I understand—just wanted to make sure you had the option.

Best regards,
Zane
ImpactQuadrant

P.S. Even without a formal partnership, I'm happy to share specific opportunities that fit your criteria on a deal-by-deal basis.
