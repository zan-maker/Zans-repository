### EMAIL 1/10: John Travaglini, CEO @ 4Front Capital Partners
**To:** john@4frontcapitalpartners.com

**Subject:** Off-market business opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi John,

I came across 4Front Capital Partners and see you're actively acquiring lower middle market businesses in the Toronto region.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities—businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces. These are owner-direct situations where we can avoid auction processes and competitive bidding.

WHAT I OFFER:
• Direct relationships with business owners
• Pre-qualified sellers ($1M-$10M EBITDA range)
• No broker intermediaries = better economics
• Focus on HVAC, plumbing, electrical, car washes, and blue-collar services

CURRENT PIPELINE EXAMPLES:
• HVAC contractor in Texas ($3.2M EBITDA, 25 years in operation)
• Car wash portfolio in Florida (4 locations, $2.8M EBITDA)
• Plumbing services company in Georgia ($1.8M EBITDA, recurring commercial contracts)

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (typically 5% of transaction value, minimum $50K).

Worth a brief 15-minute call this week or next?

Best regards,
Zane

P.S. I can share detailed business summaries if any of the above fit your criteria.
