Hi [First Name],

I come across lower middle market businesses ($5M-$50M revenue) that aren't quite right for my network, but might fit [Firm Name]'s LMM strategy.

I'm exploring referral partnerships with select PE firms. Would you be open to a brief conversation about how we might collaborate?

Best,
Sam

Following up on the referral partnership idea.

Hi [First Name],

It's been a while since we connected. I'm reaching out because I have new deal flow in the [Sector] space that reminded me of [Firm Name]'s investment focus.
