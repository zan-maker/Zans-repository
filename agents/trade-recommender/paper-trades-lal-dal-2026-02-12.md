### P&L Calculations

**LAL Win YES (66¢)**
- Contracts: $25 ÷ $0.66 = 37.88 contracts
- Payout: 37.88 × $1.00 = $37.88
- Profit: $37.88 - $25.00 = **+$12.88**

**LAL +4.5 YES (54¢)**
- Contracts: $25 ÷ $0.54 = 46.30 contracts
- Payout: 46.30 × $1.00 = $46.30
- Profit: $46.30 - $25.00 = **+$21.30**

**LAL +7.5 YES (42¢)**
- Contracts: $25 ÷ $0.42 = 59.52 contracts
- Payout: 59.52 × $1.00 = $59.52
- Profit: $59.52 - $25.00 = **+$34.52**

**LAL +10.5 YES (30¢)**
- Contracts: $25 ÷ $0.30 = 83.33 contracts
- Payout: 83.33 × $1.00 = $83.33
- Profit: $83.33 - $25.00 = **+$58.33**

**Over 238.5 YES (65¢)**
- Total: 124 + 104 = 228 points
- 228 < 238.5 = **LOSS**
- P&L: **-$25.00**

## Summary
- **Total P&L:** +$101.03
- **Win Rate:** 4/5 (80%)
- **Total Invested:** $125.00
- **Total Returned:** $226.03
- **ROI:** +80.8%

## Lessons

1. **Lakers momentum was real** - The model correctly identified Lakers' edge at home against a struggling Dallas team (4-game losing streak). All Lakers side bets cashed.

2. **Total market was inflated** - The over 238.5 line proved too aggressive. Both teams shot reasonably but pace wasn't as fast as projected. Game stayed under by 10.5 points.

3. **Longer spreads = higher returns** - The LAL +10.5 at 30¢ offered exceptional value. When the model has high confidence, extending to wider spreads can amplify returns significantly.

4. **Diversification helped** - While the total bet lost, the 4 winning Lakers positions more than offset the loss, demonstrating the value of spreading risk across correlated but distinct markets.

5. **Entry timing matters** - The Feb 13 03:30 AM UTC pricing likely captured late money on Lakers, yet still offered positive EV on all Lakers positions.
