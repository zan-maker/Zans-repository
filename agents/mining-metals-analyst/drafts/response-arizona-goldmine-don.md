We help businesses navigate the capital-raising process and connect them with the right investment partners. Given the current market environment for gold assets, we're actively evaluating opportunities in the Southwest region that may be a fit for our network of investors.

To properly assess this opportunity against our current investment criteria and determine potential fit for our investor network, could you please provide the following detailed information about the Arizona gold mine:

**Resource & Technical:**
- Exact location (county, state)
- Breakdown of the 2M oz resource (measured, indicated, inferred)
- Average grade (g/t Au)

**Transaction Details:**
