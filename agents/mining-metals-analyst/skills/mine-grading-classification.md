Purpose: fast, defensible grade classification (Low / Moderate / High / Very High) by commodity and mining method, with “ASX‑style” flags and red‑flag thresholds.

1. Gold
1.1 Open pit gold – grade bands (g/t Au)
Low grade: <0.5 g/t Au

Moderate: 0.5–1.5 g/t Au

High grade: >1.5 g/t Au

ASX‑style high‑grade open pit (for screening language):

Intercepts consistently >2 g/t Au over mineable widths; or

Local shoots >5 g/t Au that are selectively mineable.

Context: Industry references and World Gold Council‑style guidance place open‑pit “average” broadly around 0.5–1.5 g/t and “high” >1.5 g/t.

Screen outcome (open pit):

“Low”: weighted average grade <0.5 g/t and limited high‑grade shoots.

“Moderate”: 0.5–1.5 g/t, with some intervals >1.5–2 g/t.

“High”: head grade >1.5 g/t or repeated intercepts >2 g/t over mineable widths.

“Very high”: coherent zones >5 g/t in an open‑pit context (rare, may be transition to underground).

1.2 Underground gold – grade bands (g/t Au)
Low grade: 1–4 g/t Au

Moderate: 4–8 g/t Au

High grade: >8–10 g/t Au

Very high‑grade (your mandate):

Lodes or shoots >10 g/t over 2–5 m; or

Narrow but continuous structures with pockets >20 g/t, especially in historic camps.

External references: World Gold Council‑type commentary brackets “low‑quality” underground at ~1–4 g/t and “high‑quality” around 8–10 g/t.

Screen outcome (underground):

“Low”: 1–4 g/t with limited continuity.

“Moderate”: 4–8 g/t on lodes with demonstrated continuity.

“High”: >8 g/t on main lodes, repeated stoping widths.

“Very high”: shoots >10 g/t over 2–5 m or pockets >20 g/t with continuity and historical production.

1.3 Gold red flags
Sub‑1 g/t planned as underground (unless exceptional scale/by‑products).

Tiny “postage stamp” permits where grade cannot translate to tonnage.

Ultra‑narrow high‑grade veins with no demonstrated continuity or mining width.

2. Copper
2.1 Porphyry / bulk‑tonnage (open pit, % Cu)
Low grade: <0.3% Cu

Moderate: 0.3–0.7% Cu

High grade: >0.7–1.0% Cu

Tier‑1‑style high grade: zones >1% Cu, ideally with Au/Mo credits.

Context: USGS and porphyry literature typically show economic porphyry grades ~0.3–1.0% Cu, with scale compensating for lower grades.

Screen outcome (open pit porphyry):

“Low”: <0.3% Cu, only interesting with giant tonnage and strong by‑products.

“Moderate”: 0.3–0.7% Cu with scale and infrastructure.

“High”: >0.7% Cu; treat zones >1% Cu as Tier‑1‑style.

2.2 Underground / narrow‑vein copper (% Cu)
Low grade: <1% Cu

Moderate: 1–2% Cu

High grade: >2% Cu

Premium: lenses >3–4% Cu over mineable widths in established camps.

Screen outcome (underground Cu):

“Low”: <1% Cu unless very thick or with multi‑metal credits.

“Moderate”: 1–2% Cu with good widths and continuity.

“High”: >2% Cu, especially where development already exists.

“Very high”: >3–4% Cu over mineable widths close to infrastructure.

3. Silver
3.1 Primary silver deposits (g/t Ag)
Low grade: <50–70 g/t Ag

Moderate: 70–150 g/t Ag

High grade: >150–200 g/t Ag

Very high grade: >400–500 g/t Ag, even over narrow widths.

ASX commentary often treats 150 g/t+ as “high‑grade” in primary silver systems, with ultra‑high‑grade hits in the 300–1,000+ g/t range getting market attention.

Screen outcome (primary Ag):

“Low”: <70 g/t Ag at resource level.

“Moderate”: 70–150 g/t Ag.

“High”: >150–200 g/t Ag with mineable widths.

“Very high”: >400–500 g/t Ag, particularly if width/continuity are demonstrated.

3.2 Silver as by‑product (polymetallic)
Moderate: 50–100 g/t Ag with strong Zn/Pb/Cu credits.

High: >150 g/t Ag plus base‑metal credits (especially VMS or CRD).

For your use:

Target systems where mineralised envelopes are at least ~100 g/t Ag‑equivalent over tens of metres, or >300 g/t Ag over narrower underground widths.

4. VMS (Cu–Zn–Pb–Au–Ag)
4.1 Typical economic VMS “centre‑of‑mass”
Around: 5% Zn, 1–2% Cu, <1% Pb, ~1 g/t Au, 20–60 g/t Ag.

4.2 Practical screening bands (massive or semi‑massive sulphide)
Low grade VMS:

<1% Cu and <3% Zn combined, with weak precious metals.

Moderate grade VMS:

1–2% Cu or 3–6% Zn, or Cu+Zn+Pb ~4–8% combined; Au ~0.5–1.5 g/t.

High grade VMS:

Cu >2–3% and/or Zn >6–8%, or Cu+Zn+Pb >8–10% combined;

Plus Au >1–2 g/t and meaningful Ag (50–100 g/t+).

ASX‑friendly “high‑grade” VMS:

Cu ~3–8% or Zn 8–15% in massive sulphide, even at modest tonnage, with clear cluster potential or multiple lenses.

Screen outcome (VMS):

“Low”: sub‑economic combined base‑metal grade (<4% Cu+Zn+Pb) and weak Au‑Ag.

“Moderate”: 4–8% Cu+Zn+Pb or single‑metal strength but lacking precious metals.

“High”: >8–10% Cu+Zn+Pb with Au >1 g/t and Ag 50–100 g/t+; belt‑scale cluster is a strong plus.

5. Antimony (Sb)
5.1 Antimony grade bands (% Sb)
Low grade: <1% Sb

Moderate: 1–3% Sb

High grade: >3–5% Sb

Very high grade: >8–10% Sb over mineable widths.

Ideal ASX‑style project traits:

Multiple veins or lodes averaging >3% Sb, including shoots >10% Sb.

Historic production or artisanal workings with mined grades in that range.

Screen outcome (Sb):

“Low”: scattered <1% Sb with limited vein continuity.

“Moderate”: 1–3% Sb across multiple structures.

“High”: >3% Sb with shoots >8–10% Sb.

“Very high”: district with repeated >10% Sb shoots and mining history.

6. Rare Earths (REE)
6.1 Carbonatite / hard‑rock (TREO %)
Low grade: <0.5% TREO

Moderate: 0.5–1.0% TREO

High grade: >1–2% TREO

Very high grade: >3–4% TREO.

6.2 Clay / ionic adsorption (TREO ppm or %)
Low grade: <500–800 ppm TREO (<0.05–0.08%) without strong HREE bias.

Moderate: ~800–1500 ppm TREO (0.08–0.15%).

High grade: >1500–2000 ppm TREO (0.15–0.2%+) with high NdPr/Dy/Tb proportion.

For your capital:

Treat as “high‑grade” only where head grades exceed moderate band and value mix (NdPr, heavies) clearly compensates any grade deficit.

Screen outcome (REE):

“Low”: below thresholds and/or light‑REE‑heavy with poor value mix.

“Moderate”: within mid‑bands but with decent NdPr share.

“High”: >1–2% TREO (hard‑rock) or >1500–2000 ppm TREO (clays) with strong NdPr/HREE bias.

“Very high”: >3–4% TREO (hard‑rock) or unusually rich clays with premium value distribution.

Moderate: 1.0–1.3% Li2O

Very high grade: >1.7–2.0% Li2O.

7.2 Lithium – brines (mg/L Li)
Low grade: <300 mg/L

7.4 Cobalt (% Co)
Low grade: <0.05% Co

Moderate: 0.05–0.15% Co

High grade: >0.15–0.2% Co.
