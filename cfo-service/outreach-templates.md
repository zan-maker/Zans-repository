## Template 1: Recent Funding Announcement

**Subject:** Congrats on Series [A/B/C] - Finance infrastructure question

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

Congrats on the Series [A/B/C] announcement! [Specific detail from announcement - e.g., "Impressive traction in [market]"].

Quick question: With the new capital, are you finding you need more sophisticated financial infrastructure than your current setup can provide?

Most companies at your stage hit a wall where:
- Bookkeepers handle transactions but can't provide strategic guidance
- Investors want board-ready financials and KPIs
- Cash flow forecasting becomes critical (runway anxiety)
- You're planning the next phase of growth but flying blind

I work with Series A-C companies as an AI-powered fractional CFO. The model combines my 15+ years of CFO experience with AI agents that automate the heavy lifting (forecasting, reporting, reconciliation).

The result: You get Fortune 500-level financial intelligence at a fraction of a full-time CFO cost ($5K-$15K/month vs. $300K+/year).

Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Sam

P.S. - Recent client in [similar industry/stage] used this approach to raise their Series [next round] with strong financials. Happy to share the case study.

## Template 2: CFO Departure/Transition

**Subject:** CFO transition - interim support option

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] is going through a CFO transition. These moments are critical - board meetings continue, investor questions don't stop, and cash flow planning becomes even more important.

Rather than rushing to hire a permanent CFO (3-6 month search, $300K+ cost), many growth-stage companies use a fractional CFO during the transition:

**Immediate coverage:**
- Keep board reporting on track
- Maintain investor confidence
- Ensure cash flow visibility
- Handle month-end close

**Search support:**
- Define what you actually need in a permanent CFO
- Interview support and compensation benchmarking
- Smooth transition planning
- Handoff to permanent hire

I provide AI-powered fractional CFO services specifically for situations like this. The AI agents handle the operational work (reporting, forecasting, reconciliation), and I provide the strategic guidance and board presence.

Typical engagement: 3-6 months while you search, then transition to your permanent hire.

Worth a conversation?

Best,
Sam

P.S. - Can start within 2 weeks if timing is urgent.

## Template 3: Finance/Accounting Job Posting

**Subject:** Head of Finance role - alternative to consider

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

I saw [Company] is hiring for [Head of Finance / VP Finance / Finance Manager]. Before you commit to a full-time hire, wanted to float an alternative:

**AI-Powered Fractional CFO Service**

Instead of:
- $120K-$180K salary + benefits
- 3-month search process
- Risk of wrong hire
- Fixed capacity

Consider:
- $5K-$10K/month (fractional)
- Start immediately
- Scale up/down as needed
- AI + experienced CFO

**What you get:**
- Monthly financials & board decks
- 13-week cash flow forecasting
- KPI dashboards & investor reporting
- Strategic financial guidance
- Month-end close automation

**Real example:** [Similar company] was about to hire a $150K Finance Director. Instead, they used our Growth package ($10K/month). Got better reporting, saved $60K/year, and the CEO spends less time on finance.

Happy to discuss if this might fit your situation.

Best,
Sam

## Template 5: Follow-Up After No Response

**Subject:** Quick follow - fractional CFO services

**Email:**

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to follow up on my note from [date] about fractional CFO services.

I know inboxes are crazy, so quick summary:

**What I do:** AI-powered fractional CFO for Series A-C companies
**Cost:** $5K-$15K/month (vs. $300K+ full-time)  
**Deliverables:** Board decks, cash flow forecasting, KPI dashboards, strategic guidance
**Typical client:** Recently funded, 10-200 employees, needs CFO expertise but not full-time

If now's not the right time, totally understand. Happy to check back in a few months.

If you're dealing with any of these, might be worth a 15-minute call:
- Board meetings approaching and reporting isn't ready
- Cash flow stress ("will we make payroll?")
- Investors asking questions you can't answer
- Planning fundraise but financials aren't solid

Either way, best of luck with [Company].

## Template 9: Nurture Sequence (Cold Lead)

**Email 1 (Day 1):** Initial outreach (use templates above)

**Email 2 (Day 7):** Educational content
**Subject:** When to hire a fractional CFO (vs. full-time)

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How do you know when you're ready for CFO-level support vs. sticking with your bookkeeper?

Most founders hit these signals:
- Board meetings are stressful (reporting isn't ready)
- Investors ask questions you can't answer
- Cash flow forecasting is guesswork
- You're planning fundraise but financials aren't solid
- Strategic decisions need financial modeling

If 2+ apply, might be time for fractional CFO support.

I wrote a short guide on this: [Link]

Happy to discuss your specific situation if helpful.

## Template 10: LinkedIn Post (Attracting Inbound)

**Post:**

Just helped a Series B SaaS company close their books 5 days faster than before.

The secret? AI-powered month-end close automation.

Here's what we automated:
✓ Bank reconciliation (95% auto-matched)
✓ CC statement reconciliation  
✓ Prepaid expense amortization
✓ Deferred revenue recognition
✓ Intercompany eliminations

Result: Month-end close in 5 business days instead of 10.

The best part? It's not just speed - it's accuracy. Fewer errors, less stress, more time for strategic work.

If you're a growth-stage company still struggling with month-end close, might be time to consider AI-powered fractional CFO services.

DM me if you want to learn more.
