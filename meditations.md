### New Horizons

## 🌱 Proposed Seeds (Awaiting Approval)

**1. Meditation Practice Itself (Meta-Topic)**
- What makes a reflection productive vs. circular?
- How to know when a topic is "done" vs. abandoned?
- Should meditation be structured (prompts) or free-form?
- Balance between automated reflection and human feedback
- *Why:* This nightly process needs examination too — is it working?

**2. Sub-Agent Lifecycle Management**
- When to spawn vs. when to stay in main session
- Context sharing between parent and child agents
- Cleanup strategies for abandoned sub-agent sessions
- *Why:* TradeRecommender and others accumulating state suggests lifecycle gaps

**2. Memory Architecture & Retrieval**
- Daily logs vs. curated MEMORY.md — what's the right balance?
- Semantic search effectiveness — are we retrieving the right memories?
- When to remember vs. when to let go
- *Why:* MEMORY.md grows; need to ensure it stays useful, not just large

**3. Cost-Awareness as Core Competency**
- Beyond model routing: token budgeting per task type
- When expensive thinking is worth it vs. wasteful
- Teaching sub-agents to be cost-conscious
- *Why:* Identity is "cost-conscious orchestrator" — should this be explicit training?
