# Impact Quadrant Deep Research Summary
## AI Agents for Legacy Finance & ERP Modernization

**Research Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Prepared For:** Sam, Impact Quadrant  
**Objective:** Position Impact Quadrant as the AI-native fractional CFO firm

---

## Executive Summary

### The $100B+ Opportunity
Legacy finance systems and rigid ERPs create an "agility gap" for mid-market companies. Companies spend $100B+ annually on ERP customizations, integrations, and workarounds that still leave finance teams drowning in manual processes.

### The Paradigm Shift
**Old Approach:** Rip-and-replace ERP (2-year projects, 60% failure rate, $500K-$2M cost)  
**New Approach:** Agent augmentation - AI agents that work WITHIN existing systems

### Key Insight
CFOs don't want to replace Netsuite. They want **intelligent agents that bridge the gaps** - automating reconciliation, generating dynamic reports, and orchestrating cross-system workflows without the risk of migration.

## Market Landscape

### Legacy Finance Application Challenges

**1. Data Silos**
- Finance data trapped in ERP
- Sales data in CRM
- Operations data in custom systems
- Manual Excel bridges between them

**2. Reporting Rigidity**
- Custom reports require developers ($200+/hr for SuiteScript)
- Static dashboards that age immediately
- No self-service for ad-hoc questions
- Board prep takes weeks, not hours

**3. Process Friction**
- Month-end close: 15+ days for most companies
- Reconciliation: Manual matching across 5+ systems
- Forecasting: Static Excel models, outdated on day 2
- Compliance: Reactive, not preventive

**4. Scale Bottlenecks**
- Every new entity adds exponential complexity
- Headcount grows linearly with transaction volume
- Key person dependency on tribal knowledge
- Training new team members takes months

### Netsuite-Specific Pain Points

| Pain Point | Current State | Impact |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Custom Reports | Require SuiteScript developers | $10K-$50K per report |
| Workflow Limits | Rigid approval chains | Manual workarounds |
| Integration Complexity | SOAP APIs, custom scripting | 3-6 month integrations |
| Multi-Entity | Manual consolidation | Error-prone, time-intensive |
| Real-time Visibility | Batch processing delays | Decisions on stale data |
| User Experience | 1990s interface | Low adoption, workarounds |

- Scenario modeling (what-if analysis)
- Confidence intervals and risk flags
- Continuous updates (not static spreadsheets)

**4. Compliance Monitoring**
- Anomaly detection in real-time
- Policy enforcement automation
- Audit trail generation
- Fraud pattern recognition

**5. Cross-System Orchestration**

## Competitive Analysis

| Competitor Type | Their Approach | Their Weakness | Impact Quadrant Advantage |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Big 4 Consultants** | Rip-and-replace ERPs | High cost, long timelines, high failure rate | Extend, don't replace |
| **RPA Vendors (UiPath, Automation Anywhere)** | Script-based automation | Brittle, high maintenance, limited intelligence | Agentic AI with reasoning |
| **Netsuite Partners** | SuiteScript customization | Expensive, slow, creates technical debt | Agent layer above ERP |
| **Vertical AI Startups** | Single-purpose AI tools | Point solutions, don't integrate well | Unified agent platform |
| **Traditional Fractional CFOs** | Human-only advisory | Limited scalability, high hourly costs | Human + AI agent teams |
| **ERP Vendors (Oracle, SAP)** | New cloud modules | Lock-in, expensive, same rigidity | Agnostic, works with any ERP |
