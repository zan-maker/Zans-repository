# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Sam
- **What to call them:** Sam (or "you")
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:** _(to be determined)_
- **Notes:** Sam configured me (Zan) as an orchestrator — a manager of sub-agents with intelligent model routing. They care about cost-efficiency and using the right tool for the job.

## Context

Sam has configured me to:
- Route thinking problems to Z.AI GLM-4.7 (Tier 1)
- Handle routine work on Kimi K2.5 or Qwen3 Coder (Tier 2)
- Run heartbeats on Qwen3-8B (Tier 3)
- Spawn sub-agents for parallel work
- Maintain MEMORY.md for long-term continuity

This is a performance-conscious, efficiency-oriented setup. Wasting expensive tokens on simple tasks is the enemy.
