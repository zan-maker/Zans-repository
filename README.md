## What It Does

Commodity Price Analyzer is an AI agent that turns complex commodity-linked contracts into a continuously running economic model. Rather than manually pulling prices and applying contract formulas in spreadsheets, the agent fetches live market data, applies encoded business rules, and returns a plain-English interpretation of realized vs. theoretical value across multiple contract structures and counterparties.

The agent:

1. Pulls live Ni/Co/Li prices via **AlphaVantage MCP** and monitors regulatory risk via **Regulations.Gov MCP**
2. Applies encoded business rules — black mass payables, Primary Offtaker MHP offtake, lithium carbonate GTCs, and feedstock pricing
3. Returns a narrative interpretation: realized vs. theoretical payables, margin capture vs. offtaker, profit-share trigger status, and index sensitivity

A single natural-language question such as:

> *"What's our Ni/Co margin vs Offtaker this month on output?"*

triggers the full pipeline: **Memory Load → AI Model → Python Code → AI Model 1 → Output + Memory Store**.

## Encoded Contract Structures

| Contract | Index Basis | Key Rules |
|---|---|---|
| **Black Mass Payables** | LME 3-month Ni/Co | 85% grade multiplier; counterparties: Cirba, Interco |
| **Primary Offtaker MHP Offtake** | Fastmarkets MB CO-0005 monthly | 8% floor discount; 15% profit share above $20,000/mt Ni |
| **Lithium Carbonate GTC** | Fastmarkets Li₂CO₃ 99.5% CIF | Floor $20,000/mt · Ceiling $30,000/mt |
| **Feedstock** | Mixed Fastmarkets/LME composite | 92% Li @ 75% payable · 3% Ni @ 90% · 2% Co @ 90% |

## Quick Start

See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for full instructions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GLI/commodity-price-analyzer.git
# Configure credentials in Airia (see SETUP.md)
# Import flows/commodity_analyzer.json via Airia dashboard
```

Then ask the agent:
```
"What are our realized Ni payables on black mass this week vs LME?"
"Has the Primary Offtaker profit share triggered this month?"
"Show me our Li carbonate GTC position — is the floor or ceiling active?"
"Run sensitivity: what happens to MHP margins if Ni drops $1,000/mt?"
```
