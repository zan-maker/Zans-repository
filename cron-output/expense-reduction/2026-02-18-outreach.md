## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Required to Resume Outreach)
1. **Verify Hunter.io API Key** - Check if key `f701d171cf7dec7e730a6b1c6e9b74f29f39b6e` is valid
2. **Set Environment Variable** - Export `HUNTER_API_KEY` in cron environment
3. **Test API** - Run verification test before next scheduled run

### Alternative Approaches (If Hunter.io Unavailable)
1. **Manual Verification** - Sam verifies emails manually, provides verified list
2. **Alternative Service** - Use Apollo.io, RocketReach, or similar
3. **LinkedIn Outreach** - Pivot to LinkedIn messaging for these leads

---

## Next Steps

**Option A: Fix Hunter.io (Recommended)**
- Update API key or restore account
- Re-run this cron job manually
- Process pending leads with proper verification

**Option B: Manual Override**
- If Sam approves: I can manually research CEO names
- Construct likely email patterns (firstname@domain.com)
- Send with disclosure that verification was manual

**Option C: Skip Until Fixed**
- Wait for API key resolution
- Leads remain in queue
- No outreach until verification restored

## Safety Compliance Check ✓

- [x] No emails sent to unverified addresses
- [x] No generic emails used (contact@, info@, etc.)
- [x] Hunter.io verification attempted (failed auth)
