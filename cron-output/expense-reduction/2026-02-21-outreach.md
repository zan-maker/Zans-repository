### 1. Autonomize AI → Ganesh Padmanabhan
**Subject:** Reducing Healthcare Compute Costs for Autonomize AI

Hi Ganesh,

Congrats on the $4M seed and ATX VP backing for Autonomize AI. Healthcare AI companies like yours often face explosive compute costs as you scale—particularly with the GPU-intensive workloads you are running.

I help venture-backed tech companies reduce vendor/SaaS spend through continuous expense reduction technology. Our model is simple: modest monthly admin fee + success-based fees only on verified savings.

Given Autonomize's healthcare focus, I would expect significant opportunity in cloud compute optimization, AI/ML platform vendor consolidation, and healthcare SaaS tool sprawl reduction.

Worth a 10-minute conversation to see if there is a fit?

Best,
Zander

### 2. Asymbl → Brandon Metcalf
**Subject:** Salesforce Ecosystem Tool Sprawl at Asymbl

Hi Brandon,

Noticed Asymbl is building in the Salesforce ecosystem with $1.1M in funding. Companies in this space typically accumulate 20+ SaaS tools across their stack—many redundant or underutilized.

I run a technology-led continuous expense reduction service. We audit vendor spend, identify waste, and negotiate better terms. You only pay a modest monthly fee + a percentage of verified savings we deliver.

For a Salesforce-focused company like Asymbl, I would expect quick wins in AppExchange vendor consolidation, sales/marketing tool overlap elimination, and contract renewal renegotiation.

Interested in seeing what we might find?

Best,
Zander

### 3. Coder → Robert Whiteley
**Subject:** $30M Series B = Time to Audit Vendor Spend

Hi Robert,

Congrats on the $30M Series B and $200M valuation at Coder. With that kind of growth, vendor sprawl is almost inevitable—more tools, more contracts, more drift.

I help venture-backed tech companies reduce SaaS and vendor spend through continuous expense reduction. Our fee structure aligns incentives: modest monthly retainer + success fees only on verified savings.

For developer tools companies, we typically find 15-25% savings in cloud infrastructure costs, DevOps/SRE tooling overlaps, and sales/marketing tech stack bloat.

Worth a brief call to see if there is hidden spend to recover?

Best,
Zander

### 4. Wander → John Entwistle
**Subject:** Property Tech Vendor Complexity at Wander

Hi John,

Big fan of what you are building at Wander—$20M Series A and A16Z backing is serious momentum. Property tech companies face unique vendor complexity: smart home hardware, property management software, travel platform fees.

I help venture-backed companies reduce vendor/SaaS spend through technology-led continuous expense reduction. We charge a modest monthly fee + only get paid on verified savings we deliver.

For Wander specifically, I would expect opportunities in smart home hardware vendor consolidation, travel platform fee optimization, and property management tool audit.

Interested in a quick conversation to explore?

Best,
Zander

### 5. Sprinter Health → Max Cohen
**Subject:** Healthcare Staffing OPEX Optimization

Hi Max,

Congrats on the Series B at Sprinter Health. Healthcare staffing companies face unique OPEX challenges—logistics costs, clinician platform fees, compliance tooling.

I help venture-backed healthcare companies reduce vendor spend through continuous expense reduction technology. Our model: modest monthly admin fee + success-based fees only on verified savings.

For Sprinter's last-mile healthcare model, I would expect savings in logistics/vendor platform costs, compliance/SaaS tool consolidation, and T&E optimization for distributed clinicians.

Worth a 10-minute call to see if there is a fit?

Best,
Zander
