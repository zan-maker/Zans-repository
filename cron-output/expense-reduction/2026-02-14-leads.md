## 🔧 Data Enrichment Notes

**Successful Enrichment:**
- Tavily API: Primary search source, provided funding data and company details
- Abstract API: Limited use due to rate limiting (2 successful calls)
- Hunter.io: Authentication issues (API key not working)
- Zyte: Not used (would require additional setup)

1. Fix Hunter.io API authentication for email enrichment
2. Upgrade Abstract API plan for better rate limits
3. Add LinkedIn Sales Navigator scraping via Zyte
4. Add Apollo.io integration for contact enrichment
