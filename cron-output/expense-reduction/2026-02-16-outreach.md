## Hunter.io Verification Error

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "authentication_failed",
      "code": 401,
      "details": "No user found for the API key supplied"
    }
  ]
}
```

**API Key Used:** f701d171cf7decf7e730a6b1c6e9b74f29f39b6e

**Issue:** Hunter.io API key is invalid or expired. Email verification is mandatory per outreach protocol.

---

## Action Required

**Sam - Hunter.io API key needs to be updated.** 

The current API key is returning 401 authentication errors. To resume email outreach:

1. Log in to Hunter.io dashboard: https://hunter.io
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update the API key in:
   - TOOLS.md
   - Cron job configuration
   - Environment variables (if stored there)

**Safety Protocol:** No emails were sent due to inability to verify deliverability. This is the correct behavior per the established rules:
- ✅ Never send to generic emails (3 skipped)
- ✅ Never send without Hunter.io verification (5 pending)
- ✅ Log all skips with reasons

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Hunter.io API key** (priority)
2. **Re-run verification** for the 5 personal emails
3. **Send personalized outreach** to verified leads only
4. **Log results** to this file

---

## Email Templates Ready

Technology/SaaS templates are prepared for:
- OpenRouter (AI Infrastructure, high cloud spend)
- Coast (FinTech, heavy vendor spend)
- Gridline (Wealth Management, compliance costs)
- Aescape (Robotics, hardware supply chain)
- Traba (Tech/Staffing, rapid expansion)

All templates will be personalized with company-specific details once verification is complete.
