## Warm Lead Email Attempt

### 1. John Zhao - Blossom Health (Score 72)

**Status:** EMAIL NOT SENT - API Error
**To:** john@joinblossomhealth.com
**CC:** sam@impactquadrant.info
**Subject:** Optimizing Blossom Health's Spend

**Key Personalization:**
- $20M Series A funding
- AI psychiatry platform
- Early stage with significant runway
- Small team = no procurement function yet

**Message Drafted:**
```
Hi John,

I noticed Blossom Health raised a $20M Series A - congrats on the funding!

As you scale your AI psychiatry platform with this new capital, you're likely seeing vendor spend expand rapidly across infrastructure, compliance tools, and go-to-market tech stack.

We help healthcare companies like yours reduce operational costs through a technology-led approach. Our model is simple: a modest monthly fee, and we only charge success fees on verified, documented savings - typically 15-25% of vendor spend.

No upfront risk, results-driven.

Would you be open to a brief call this week to see if there's an opportunity for Blossom Health?

Best,
Zander

**Issue:** AgentMail.to API endpoint returned "NotFoundError" - email sending infrastructure needs troubleshooting.

## Notes

- Today's export file (2026-02-23-export.csv) does not exist - using yesterday's export (2026-02-22)
- Hunter.io API key (f65adb440d1d4be20ae1b75f972b637b3e04b8fa) working correctly
- Generic email filtering worked correctly
- SMTP verification caught 2 invalid emails
- Hunter score threshold (50) correctly filtered out Nathan Lee's email
- Gibberish flag on Sprinter Health's email was precautionary skip despite 100 score
- Rad AI (Barrett Dwyer) already contacted on 2026-02-22 - avoiding duplicate outreach
- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** AgentMail.to API endpoint not accessible - email sending infrastructure needs investigation
- 1 warm lead (Blossom Health - John Zhao) had valid email but could not be sent due to API error

## Email Infrastructure Issues

**AgentMail.to API Error:**
- Endpoint: https://api.agentmail.to/v1/send
- Error: "Route not found" (NotFoundError)
- API Key: am_77026a53e8d003ce63a3187d06d61e897ee389b9ec479d50bdaeefeda868b32f
- Status: Needs investigation - verify API documentation and correct endpoint

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Verify AgentMail.to API documentation for correct endpoint
2. Test API authentication with a simple request
3. Consider fallback to SMTP if API issues persist
4. Document email sending protocol in TOOLS.md
