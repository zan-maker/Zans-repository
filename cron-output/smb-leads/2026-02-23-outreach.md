## Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Leads Reviewed** | 5 |
| **Emails Sent (This Run)** | 1 |
| **Skipped - Undeliverable** | 4 |

### Success Rate: 20% (1/5 emails deliverable)

All emails were personal (not generic), but 4 of 5 failed Hunter.io verification due to incorrect email patterns. The leads were generated using estimated email patterns (firstname@domain.com) which may not match actual corporate email formats.

### Recommendation
Consider implementing domain-level email verification before estimating patterns, or use professional email discovery services (Hunter.io Email Finder, RocketReach, ZoomInfo) to get verified emails rather than estimating patterns.
