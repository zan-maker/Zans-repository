## Notes for Next Run

- Hunter.io API authentication failed - need to verify API key
- Abstract API hit rate limits - need to throttle requests
- Yellow Pages/Zembra API not accessed - should prioritize for local business discovery
- Healthcare sector underrepresented - need targeted search for medical practices, urgent care, home health
- Consider searching: Nashville, Tampa, Phoenix, Denver, Austin markets
- Focus on job postings for "CFO" or "Controller" as signals of need
