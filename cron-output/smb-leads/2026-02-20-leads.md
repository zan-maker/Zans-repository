## 🔍 Research Notes

### Data Challenges
- **Hunter.io API:** Authentication failed - API key may be expired/invalid
- **Abstract API:** Connection errors - check network/endpoint
- **Yellow Pages/Zembra:** API endpoint returned "resource not found" - documentation shows accommodation/pricing focus, not business listings

### Successful Sources
- **Brave Search API:** Primary discovery tool - excellent results
- **Company websites:** Team pages provided most decision maker info
- **LinkedIn:** Executive profiles confirmed titles and company size
- **RocketReach/ZoomInfo:** Referenced for email patterns (not directly accessed)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Verify Hunter.io API key or regenerate
2. Test Abstract API endpoint manually
3. Consider Apollo.io or Lusha as backup enrichment sources
4. For top 5 leads, manually verify emails via LinkedIn outreach or company contact forms
