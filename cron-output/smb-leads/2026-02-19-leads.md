## 🎯 Top 5 Outreach Priorities

### 1. **Creative Solutions in Healthcare** (Score: 90)
**Reason:** 100+ facilities across Texas, rapid growth, no CFO on leadership team, complex multi-location payroll. CEO is founder - likely handling finances directly.

**Outreach Angle:** "As CEO of a rapidly growing 100+ facility healthcare organization, you know the complexity of managing finances across multiple locations. Many healthcare CEOs in your position are turning to fractional CFOs to provide strategic financial oversight without the full-time cost."

### 2. **Cru Hospitality Group** (Score: 85)
**Reason:** Fast-growing restaurant group with 4 concepts, multiple locations, 2025 40 Under 40 honoree. CEO started in operations - likely strong on hospitality, weaker on finance.

**Reason:** Complex multi-property hospitality operations, historic restoration projects (complex financing), founder still active after 19 years.

**Outreach Angle:** "The historic hotel revival projects you're undertaking require sophisticated financial structuring. From The Baker Hotel to your Austin properties, a fractional CFO could help optimize financing and cash flow across your portfolio."

### 5. **Jet Health Inc.** (Score: 72)
**Reason:** New CEO appointment (May 2023), home health industry complexity, growth/acquisition mandate. New leadership often brings new vendor evaluations.
