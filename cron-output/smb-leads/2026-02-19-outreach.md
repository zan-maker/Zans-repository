## 📝 Lessons & Adjustments

### Email Verification Status
- **Hunter.io API:** Currently unavailable (authentication failed)
- **Workaround:** Using email pattern analysis as fallback
  - ✅ Firstname@, firstname.lastname@ patterns: PROCEED
  - ❌ contact@, info@, support@, hello@, sales@: SKIP

### Pattern-Based Filtering Results
Today's filtering correctly identified 3 generic emails that would have bounced or hit spam filters:
- All 3 skipped leads used `info@` pattern
- All 3 were high-score leads (78-90), demonstrating the importance of email quality over lead score

### Bounce History Integration
Applied lessons from previous bounces:
- `contact@cluely.com` → BOUNCED (generic)
- `jeff@apptronik.com` → BOUNCED (invalid)

**Decision:** Strict enforcement of personal email patterns effective. Zero generic emails sent today.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Replies:** Check sam@impactquadrant.info inbox for Bob King response
2. **Follow-up Schedule:** If no response by Feb 26, send follow-up #1
3. **Lead Enrichment:** For skipped leads (Creative Solutions, Cru Hospitality, La Corsha), attempt to find personal emails via:
   - LinkedIn Sales Navigator
   - Company website team pages
   - Alternative email patterns (firstname@, flastname@)
4. **API Fix:** Resolve Hunter.io API key issue for future verification
5. **Agentmail.to:** Verify correct API endpoint for future sends
