Hi Tyler,

I came across Alpine Investors and see you're actively acquiring services, software, and healthcare businesses in the lower middle market.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities—businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces. These are owner-direct situations where we can avoid auction processes and competitive bidding.

WHAT I OFFER:
• Direct relationships with business owners
• Pre-qualified sellers ($1M-$10M EBITDA range)
• No broker intermediaries = better economics
• Focus on services, software, healthcare, and technology-enabled businesses

CURRENT PIPELINE EXAMPLES:
• B2B services company ($4.1M EBITDA, 20 years in operation)
• Healthcare services business ($2.5M EBITDA, recurring revenue model)
• Software-enabled services firm ($3.8M EBITDA, strong retention)

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (typically 5% of transaction value, minimum $50K).

Worth a brief 15-minute call this week or next?

Best regards,
Zander

P.S. I can share detailed business summaries if any of the above fit your criteria.
