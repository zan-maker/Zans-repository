Hi Mitch,

I came across Merida Capital Partners and see you're actively investing in the cannabis and alternative wellness sectors in the lower middle market.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities—businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces. These are owner-direct situations where we can avoid auction processes and competitive bidding.

WHAT I OFFER:
• Direct relationships with business owners
• Pre-qualified sellers ($1M-$10M EBITDA range)
• No broker intermediaries = better economics
• Focus on cannabis, wellness services, and related infrastructure

CURRENT PIPELINE EXAMPLES:
• Cannabis cultivation facility ($4.5M EBITDA, licensed operation)
• Wellness services business ($2.8M EBITDA, recurring revenue model)
• Ancillary cannabis services company ($3.1M EBITDA, strong market position)

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (typically 5% of transaction value, minimum $50K).

Worth a brief 15-minute call this week or next?

Best regards,
Zane

P.S. I can share detailed business summaries if any of the above fit your criteria.
