Hi Brent,

I came across Permanent Equity and deeply respect your unique approach to building a forever home for businesses. Your philosophy of permanent capital and long-term holding aligns with the type of owner-focused transitions I help facilitate.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities—businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces. These are owner-direct situations where founders can find the right long-term home for their companies without the pressure of traditional private equity timelines.

WHAT I OFFER:
• Direct relationships with business owners seeking legacy-preserving transitions
• Pre-qualified sellers ($1M-$10M EBITDA range)
• No broker intermediaries = authentic, direct conversations
• Focus on businesses with strong cultures and long-tenured employees

CURRENT PIPELINE EXAMPLES:
• HVAC contractor in Texas ($3.2M EBITDA, 25 years in operation, founder looking for succession)
• Car wash portfolio in Florida (4 locations, $2.8M EBITDA, family-owned)
• Plumbing services company in Georgia ($1.8M EBITDA, recurring commercial contracts, 20+ year history)

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can bring you off-market deals that fit your permanent equity model. No intermediary fees on my side—just introductions to founders who value what you're building.

Worth a brief conversation?

Best regards,
Zane
