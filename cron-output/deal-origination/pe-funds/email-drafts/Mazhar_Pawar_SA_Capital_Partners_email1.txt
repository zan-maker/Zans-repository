Subject: Off-market business opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi Mazhar,

I came across SA Capital Partners and see you're actively acquiring lower-to-middle market businesses.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities - businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces.

**What I offer:**
- Direct relationships with business owners
- Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
- No broker intermediaries = better economics for everyone
- Focus on blue-collar services: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, car washes, commercial cleaning

**Current pipeline includes:**
- HVAC businesses (TX, FL, GA markets)
- Plumbing contractors (various metros)
- Car wash operations (metro areas)
- Other blue-collar services ($1M-$10M EBITDA range)

All off-market, all owner-direct.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (5% of transaction value, minimum $50K).

Worth a brief 15-minute call?

Best regards,
Zane

P.S. I can share detailed business summaries from my current pipeline if helpful.
