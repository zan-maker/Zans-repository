## 📝 Notes & Observations

### What worked:
- Expertise.com provides high-quality curated lists
- Houston Chronicle "Best Of" lists are excellent sources
- Multi-trade contractors (plumbing+HVAC+electrical) are premium targets

### Blockers:
- Brave API rate limiting (1 req/min on free tier)
- Browser automation unavailable for Craigslist
- Need database access for SOS/SBA/Permit searches

### Key Insights:
1. **Houston is a goldmine** — Older established contractors with 35-75 year histories
2. **Multi-trade convergence** — Companies offering plumbing+HVAC+electrical command premium valuations
3. **Family-owned signals** — 2nd/3rd generation ownership = succession planning needs
4. **License verification** — All leads have verified TSBPE licenses

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate:** Email verification via Hunter.io for all 24 leads
2. **Short-term:** Expand to Phoenix, Tampa, Denver markets
3. **Medium-term:** Subscribe to SOS filing data feeds for TX, FL, AZ
4. **Long-term:** Build CRM pipeline to track owner responses

## 🔁 Next Run: 2026-02-19

**Focus areas:**
- Atlanta HVAC contractors (follow through on plan)
- Craigslist business-for-sale monitoring (all Texas markets)
