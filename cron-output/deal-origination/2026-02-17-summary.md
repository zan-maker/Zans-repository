## 📝 Notes & Observations

**What worked:**

- Tavily search provided good structured data
- Dallas market shows strong concentration of established contractors

**Blockers:**
- Brave API not configured (use Tavily as backup)
- Browser automation unavailable (Chrome extension not attached)
- Need database access for SOS/SBA/Permit searches

**Recommendations:**
1. Set up Brave API key for faster searches
2. Configure browser automation for Craigslist/LinkedIn
3. Subscribe to SOS filing data feeds for TX, FL, GA
4. Consider hiring VA for manual Google Maps data entry
