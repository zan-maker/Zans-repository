## 📈 MARKET INTELLIGENCE

### Funding Trend Observations

1. **AI Dominance:** 7/10 leads are AI companies
2. **Mega-Rounds Abound:** Multiple $100M+ rounds (Simile $100M, Flapping Airplanes $180M, Taalas $169M, World Labs $1B)
3. **Seed Inflation:** Traditional seed ($2-5M) still exists but "seed" now includes $10M+ rounds
4. **Geographic Diversification:** Strong activity in UK (Tangible, Stacks), India (Pluto, C2i, Smallest), NZ (Contented)
5. **Fintech/Finance Automation Hot:** Stacks ($23M), Tangible ($4.3M) both finance infrastructure plays

### Target Market Adjustments

Given the data, ImpactQuadrant may want to:
- **Expand to Series A:** Many Series A companies ($15-30M range) still need fractional CFO before full-time hire
- **Geographic Expansion:** Strong deal flow in UK/Europe and India
- **Vertical Specialization:** Consider fintech/AI specialization given deal density

### Competition Notes

Multiple companies in this batch are themselves finance/CFO-related:
- **Tangible:** Debt financing platform for hardtech
- **Stacks:** AI accounting automation
- **Smallest.ai:** Finance sector voice agents

**Opportunity:** Partner with rather than compete with these companies. They may need CFO services themselves AND could refer clients.
