## 🔥 Hot Leads (Score 70+)

1. **Breezy** (Score: 85) | Stage: Pre-seed
   - **Funding:** $10M via Venture Capital (Feb 2, 2026)
   - **Location:** Los Angeles, CA

   - **Industry:** PropTech / AI
   - **Trigger:** Recent funding + rapid hiring signal
   - **Contact:** breezy.ai / LinkedIn
   - **Why:** Just raised $10M pre-seed for AI OS for real estate. Real estate transactions = complex financial modeling. Early stage with significant capital needs financial infrastructure. No public CFO presence.

   - **Industry:** AI / E-commerce

## 🎯 Why Pre-Seed/Seed?

Sam's thesis: Series A+ can afford full-time CFOs ($200K+), but pre-seed/seed companies ($1M-$5M raised) need financial infrastructure without the full-time cost. Perfect fit for fractional CFO at $5K-$10K/month.

### Key Signals Present in This Batch:
- ✅ Recent funding (within 30 days) = capital to pay for services
- ✅ Early stage (pre-seed/seed) = need infrastructure, not full-time hire
- ✅ AI/ML focus = complex revenue recognition + burn modeling needed
- ✅ Rapid hiring signals = payroll scaling + cash flow management
- ✅ Cross-border operations = tax complexity

### Scoring Methodology
| Signal | Points Applied |
|--------|----------------|
| Seed funding ($1M-$5M) | +35 |
| Pre-seed funding ($250K-$1M) | +40 |
| 5-20 employees | +20 |
| No CFO on team (assumed) | +20 |
| Recent funding (<30 days) | +25 |
| Rapid hiring/expansion | +10 |
| International expansion | +10 |
| Series A+ or >$10M | -50 (excluded) |
