   - Prioritize high-value queries

2. **Email Verification Pending:** No emails verified yet. Hunter.io API ready but not executed.

3. **Contact Discovery:** Need LinkedIn Sales Navigator or similar for decision-maker identification.

4. **Data Completeness:** Limited to public funding announcements. Need deeper Crunchbase/AngelList integration.
