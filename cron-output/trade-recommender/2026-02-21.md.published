## ⚠️ RISK DISCLOSURE

### General Risks
1. **Prediction markets are speculative** - You can lose your entire stake
2. **Market efficiency** - Edge calculations rely on subjective probability estimates
3. **Liquidity risk** - Low-volume markets may have wide spreads
4. **Regulatory uncertainty** - Ongoing CFTC/state legal battles
5. **Information asymmetry** - Insiders may have material non-public information

### Strategy-Specific Risks
**Strategy A (High-Edge):**
- Short timeframes increase variance
- Binary outcomes = all-or-nothing results
- News events can cause sudden price swings

**Strategy B (Penny Options):**
- Low probability events by definition rarely occur
- Long duration = capital tied up, opportunity cost
- "True probability" estimates are inherently uncertain
- Kelly criterion sizing assumes accurate edge calculation

**Stock Trading:**
- 5% stop losses may be triggered by normal volatility
- Paper trading differs from live execution (slippage, fills)
- Technical analysis is not predictive of future results

## APPENDIX: KELLY CRITERION CALCULATIONS

For Strategy B positions (simplified):

**Formula:** f* = (bp - q) / b
Where: b = odds received, p = probability of win, q = probability of loss (1-p)

**US Recession Example:**
- Entry: 4¢ (payout $1 = 25:1)
- Estimated true probability: 15%
- f* = (24 × 0.15 - 0.85) / 24 = 2.75 / 24 = 11.5%
- Conservative sizing: 25% of Kelly = ~3% of bankroll
- With $1,000 allocation: $30 → rounded to $25 max

**Note:** Actual sizing limited to $25/position as per conservative guidelines regardless of Kelly output.
