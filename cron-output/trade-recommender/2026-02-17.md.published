### Market Regime Assessment
| Indicator | Reading | Signal |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **VIX** | ~20.60-20.82 | 🟡 **ELEVATED** (>20 threshold pierced) |
| **SPY** | $681.75 (+0.07%) | Neutral trend |
| **Volatility Regime** | "Return of Fear" | **OPPORTUNITY ZONE** |

**Key Insight:** VIX piercing 20 indicates elevated volatility and potential mean-reversion opportunities. Market calm proved temporary as "sticky" inflation concerns persist.

#### 1. **NVDA** — BUY

- **Entry:** ~$140-145 (watch for pullback)
- **Stop:** $136 (-5%)
- **Target:** $159 (+10%)
- **Confidence:** 7/10
- **Rationale:** Elon Musk and Tim Cook warning about memory chip shortages. AI demand is "hammering profits" and inflating prices. NVDA positioned as infrastructure play.
- **Position Size:** $1,000 max

#### 2. **BABA** — SHORT-TERM BUY (Contrarian)
- **Signal:** Pentagon blacklist confusion = volatility = opportunity
- **Entry:** Watch for washout below $85
- **Stop:** $80 (-5%)
- **Target:** $95 (+12%)
- **Confidence:** 6/10
- **Rationale:** Pentagon added then WITHDREW blacklist within minutes. Creates panic-selling opportunity. Chinese tech oversold on regulatory noise.
- **Risk:** High volatility — size accordingly
- **Position Size:** $500 (half position due to risk)

#### 3. **WBD** — BUY (M&A Catalyst)
- **Signal:** Warner Bros Discovery may engage with Paramount

- **Confidence:** 6/10
- **Rationale:** Ellison family sweetened offer with concessions. M&A drama heating up. WBD has Netflix deal providing floor.
- **Position Size:** $1,000 max

### Sector Rotation Watch
- **Financials (XLF):** Monitor for rate sentiment shifts
- **Tech (XLK):** AI infrastructure demand strong
- **Energy (XLE):** Energy crisis + geopolitical tensions
- **Industrials (XLI):** Japan avoiding recession = global demand signal

## 🎯 Kalshi Prediction Markets

### High-Edge Opportunities

#### 1. **Fed Decision in March 2026**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Market** | Fed maintains rate vs Cut 25bps |
| **Implied Odds** | 93% maintain / 7% cut |
| **Edge Assessment** | ⚠️ LOW EDGE — Market pricing is efficient |
| **Volume** | $9.6M+ |
| **Resolution** | March 19, 2026 |
| **Recommendation** | **PASS** — No value at these odds |

**Analysis:** Market is heavily pricing in Fed pause. CFTC Chair Selig's comments suggest regulatory caution. Only trade if you have contrarian data suggesting cut probability >10%.

---

#### 2. **CPI in February (MoM)**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Market** | Above 0.2% vs Below |
| **Implied Odds** | 56% Above 0.2% |
| **Edge Assessment** | 🟡 MODERATE — Watch for survey data |
| **Volume** | $16,949 |
| **Resolution** | March 11, 2026 |
| **Recommendation** | **WATCH** — Wait for pre-release surveys |

**Analysis:** 56% feels low if inflation is truly "sticky" as VIX suggests. Monitor Bloomberg surveys 1-2 days before release for edge.

---

#### 3. **Inflation YoY in February (Above 2.4%)**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Market** | Above 2.4% |
| **Implied Odds** | 45% |
| **Edge Assessment** | 🟢 **POTENTIAL VALUE** |
| **Volume** | $37,754 |
| **Resolution** | March 11, 2026 |
| **Recommendation** | **CONSIDER SMALL YES POSITION at 45¢** |

**Rationale:** 
- VIX elevated suggests market pricing in uncertainty
- "Sticky" inflation narrative gaining traction
- Fed maintaining rates = inflation not fully tamed
- True probability likely 50-55%, market at 45% = 5-10% edge

**Sizing:** Conservative 1% of bankroll (Kelly: ~10% edge / 2.2 odds = ~4.5% optimal, use 1% for safety)

---

#### 4. **Sports: 2026 NBA Champion — Oklahoma City Thunder**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Current Price** | 36¢ (36% implied) |
| **Volume** | $258.2M total, $1.5M 24h |
| **Edge Assessment** | Compare to Vegas lines |
| **Resolution** | June 2026 |
| **Recommendation** | **RESEARCH vs VEGAS** — High liquidity allows position building |

**Analysis:** 
- $258M volume = deep liquidity
- Compare Thunder 36% to FanDuel/DraftKings odds
- If Thunder <30% at sportsbooks, there's arbitrage
- Risk: Long-dated, capital tied up

---

#### 5. **Sports: 2026 NHL Stanley Cup — Canada**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Current Price** | 55¢ (55% implied) |
| **Volume** | $9.0M total, $1.3M open interest |
| **Resolution** | Feb 21, 2026 (CLOSING SOON) |
| **Recommendation** | **HIGH PRIORITY — Near-term resolution** |

**Analysis:**
- Resolves in 4 days — quick capital turnover
- Compare to Vegas odds on Canada gold medal
- Winter Olympics context adds volatility
- Volume sufficient for position entry/exit
