**Edge:** 4-7%  
**Confidence:** 7/10  
**Volume:** $239,550  
**Resolves:** February 16, 2026 (TODAY)

---

## Why This Qualifies:
Sportsbooks (DraftKings, BetUS, FanDuel) price Team USA Stripes at +155 to +175 (36-39% implied probability), while Kalshi trades at 32¢ (32% implied). This represents a 4-7% edge.

## Confidence Factors:
- ✅ **Sportsbook Consensus:** Multiple books agree on +155 to +175 range (36-39% implied)
- ✅ **Team Form:** Stripes went 2-0 in round-robin, beating both Stars (42-40) and World (48-45)
- ✅ **Market Liquidity:** $239K+ volume confirms active price discovery
- ⚠️ **Format Risk:** First-year 3-team format creates uncertainty; 12-minute games = higher variance
- ⚠️ **Motivation Risk:** All-Star exhibitions have inconsistent effort levels

## Execution Notes:
- **Kalshi Market:** KXNBAALLSTARGAME-26-STRIPES
- **Current Kalshi Odds:** Team World 39% / Team USA Stripes 32% / Team USA Stars 29%
- **Sportsbook Comparison:**
  - DraftKings: World +160 / Stripes +175 / Stars +205
  - BetUS: Stripes +160 / World +160 / Stars +200
  - SportsLine: Stripes +155 / World +160 / Stars +200
- **Tournament Final:** Team USA Stripes vs Team USA Stars (based on round-robin results)

---

## Risk Disclosure:
All-Star games are exhibitions with unpredictable effort levels. The new 3-team format introduces structural uncertainty. 12-minute games amplify variance. Past All-Star MVP results show randomness (last 5 winners: Curry x2, Lillard, Tatum, Giannis). This is a statistical edge play, not a certainty.
