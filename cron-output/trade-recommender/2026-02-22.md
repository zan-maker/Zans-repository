## 📈 Stock Opportunities (Alpaca Paper Trading)

### Market Regime Analysis

| Metric | Current Level | Signal |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **VIX** | 19.09 (-5.64%) | Normalizing from elevated levels |
| **Previous Close** | 20.23 | - |
| **Day Range** | 18.76 - 21.21 | - |
| **52-Week Range** | 13.38 - 60.13 | - |

**Interpretation:** VIX dropped 5.64% Friday, closing at 19.09. This signals volatility normalizing after recent elevation. Markets are stabilizing post-Supreme Court tariff ruling.

### Sector Rotation Analysis

**Current Leadership (Source: Seeking Alpha Feb 2026 Chartbook):**
- **LEADING:** Industrials (XLI), Energy (XLE), Materials (XLB)
- **LAGGING:** Technology (XLK), Communication Services (XLC), Financials (XLF)

**Key Insight:** The "tangible economy" rotation continues — industrials and energy outperforming tech. This is a regime shift worth monitoring for sector-based trades.

### New Opportunities

#### 1. **GOOGL - Alphabet Inc.** ⭐ HIGH CONVICTION
- **Action:** BUY
- **Signal:** Supreme Court tariff ruling catalyst
- **Current Price:** ~$314.90 (up 3.74% Friday)
- **Day Range:** $304.71 - $316.68
- **Catalyst:** Supreme Court overturned Trump tariffs Friday, lifting ad-tech stocks
- **Stop Loss:** $299.15 (-5%)
- **Target:** $346.39 (+10%)
- **Confidence:** 7/10
- **Rationale:** Regulatory overhang removed; Citi reiterated Buy with "decade-low valuation vs forward earnings"

#### 2. **RYTM - Rhythm Pharmaceuticals** ⭐ BIOTECH CATALYST
- **Action:** BUY
- **Signal:** FDA PDUFA catalyst (March 20, 2026)
- **Catalyst:** FDA decision on Imcivree for acquired hypothalamic obesity
- **PDUFA Date:** March 20, 2026 (26 days)
- **Stop Loss:** -5% from entry
- **Target:** +15-25% on approval
- **Confidence:** 6/10
- **Rationale:** PDUFA extension suggests FDA actively reviewing; acquired HO is large addressable market (larger than existing approved indications combined). However, extension from Dec 2025 adds uncertainty.

#### 3. **Oversold Bounce Candidates** (Mean Reversion)
Based on RSI < 30 scan from stockanalysis.com:

| Symbol | Company | RSI | Price | Signal |
|--------|---------|-----|-------|--------|
| **SPSC** | SPS Commerce | 12.12 | $57.95 | Oversold - potential bounce |
| **TEAM** | Atlassian | 18.15 | $75.98 | Tech oversold - watch for entry |
| **QLYS** | Qualys | 18.05 | $92.66 | Cybersecurity oversold |
| **HIMS** | Hims & Hers Health | 16.58 | $15.63 | Recent weakness - potential recovery |

**Strategy:** Small positions ($500-700 each) on oversold quality names. Use 5% stop, 8% target.

## 🎯 Kalshi Prediction Markets

### Market Overview
- **Kalshi Daily Volume:** $466M (Jan 12 record)
- **Kalshi Weekly Volume:** $2.26B

### High-Edge Opportunities (≤10 Day Settlement)

*Scanning for markets with 4%+ edge, >$50K volume, ≤10 days to settlement...*

#### No High-Edge Short-Term Opportunities Identified

**Reason:** Current Kalshi markets are either:
- Long-duration (March Madness settles April, NBA MVP settles June)
- Low edge (efficiently priced)
- Insufficient volume data available via search

**Recommendation:** Monitor daily for short-term opportunities. Best windows: Fed meeting weeks, earnings seasons, sporting events.

### Penny Options (1¢-5¢, Long Duration) ⭐ STRATEGY B FOCUS

#### 1. **NBA Championship - Longshot Teams**
- **Market:** Pro Basketball Champion
- **Strategy:** Look for teams priced at 2¢-5¢ with realistic path
- **Volume:** 62,694+ contracts (championship market)
- **Settlement:** June 2026 (NBA Finals)
- **Catalyst:** Playoff positioning, injury news, trade deadline
- **True Probability Assessment:** Teams with 5-10% realistic chance trading at 2-4¢ = 3x-5x edge
- **Recommended Position:** $25 max (500-2,500 contracts)
- **Target Return:** 5x-10x

#### 2. **NBA MVP - Value Candidates**
- **Market Insight:** Nikola Jokic MVP has 2M+ volume, 975K open interest

- **Potential:** Find next Cunningham before the surge
- **Settlement:** June 2026
- **Recommended Position:** $15-25

#### 3. **March Madness 2026 - NCAA Tournament**
- **Market Type:** Championship, Final Four qualifiers, 1-seed markets
- **Volume Expectation:** Following $350M NCAA basketball week in January
- **Catalyst:** Selection Sunday (March 15), Tournament (March 19-April 7)
- **Strategy:** Look for teams with high seed potential at 3¢-5¢
- **Example:** Miami to make Round of 64 at 73¢ (favored) - look for undervalued similar plays
- **Research Finding:** Michigan mentioned as value at "4-to-1" (presumably 20-25¢ range)
- **Recommended Position:** $25 max per team

#### 4. **Fed Interest Rate Markets**
- **Market:** Fed rate decision contracts
- **Fed Research:** Kalshi beats fed funds futures forecasts
- **Strategy:** Look for tail scenarios priced at 2¢-5¢
- **Current Signal:** Kalshi traders pricing 64% probability of 25bp cut
- **Catalyst:** FOMC meetings (next: likely March 18-19)
- **Settlement:** Varies by contract
- **Recommended Position:** $10-20 on outlier scenarios

### Excluded Markets
- **Short-term sports props:** Insufficient volume/edge data via search
- **Economic releases:** Need real-time pricing (CPI, payrolls, etc.)
