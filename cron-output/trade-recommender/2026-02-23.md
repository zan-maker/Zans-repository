- **Market:** S&P price range today at 4pm EDT
- **Type:** Range brackets (e.g., 6925-6949, 6975-6999)
- **Edge Potential:** 4-7% (based on historical SPY volatility patterns)
- **Confidence:** 7/10
- **Settlement:** Same day (≤10 days ✓)
- **Volume:** $20K+ (liquid)
- **Rationale:** SPY closed at $689.43 on Friday with 100M volume. Monday range markets offer mean-reversion opportunities. Kalshi S&P markets show 4.98x-6.74x odds on near-the-money brackets.
- **Recommended:** Research specific bracket pricing at market open

#### 2. Fed Rate Decision Markets
- **Market:** FOMC rate decision outcomes
- **Type:** Binary (rate hike/hold/cut)
- **Edge Potential:** Variable by meeting date
- **Confidence:** 8/10
- **Settlement:** FOMC meeting date (check specific dates)
- **Special Factor:** NBER study confirms Kalshi has "perfect forecast record" since 2022 - market is highly efficient but may offer pre-announcement edge during volatile periods
- **Rationale:** Fed economists now acknowledge Kalshi provides "faster and more accurate read on inflation, growth, unemployment, interest rates than traditional sources"
- **Recommended:** Monitor for pricing dislocations ahead of FOMC meetings

### Penny Options (1¢-5¢, Long Duration - STRATEGY B)

⚠️ **Searching for penny opportunities (1¢-5¢ with true probability >10%):**

#### 1. UCLA Women's Basketball Championship (NCAA Futures)
- **Market:** 2026 NCAA Women's Basketball Champion
- **Current Price:** **12¢** ✓ (within penny range)
- **True Probability Estimate:** 18-22%
- **Edge:** 6-10% (50-80% mispricing)
- **Settlement:** March 2026 (~30 days - acceptable for penny strategy)
- **Potential Return:** 4.5x-7x
- **Story/Catalyst:** UConn heavily favored at 65¢; UCLA at 12¢ offers value. Women's tournament increasingly competitive. If UCLA gets favorable draw, could make deep run.
- **Position Size:** $25 max
- **Confidence:** 6/10
- **Rationale:** 12¢ implies ~12% win probability. UCLA is legitimate contender with tournament experience. UConn's 65¢ is overpriced; value lies in UCLA "No" (88¢) or looking for other contenders.

#### 2. Tottenham vs Arsenal - Underdog Value
- **Market:** North London Derby winner
- **Current Price:** **Tottenham at 17¢** (borderline penny)
- **True Probability Estimate:** 25-28%
- **Edge:** 8-11%
- **Settlement:** Same day (≤10 days)
- **Potential Return:** 4.9x
- **Story/Catalyst:** Tottenham home underdog at 17¢ vs Arsenal 62¢. Derby matches historically unpredictable. Home field advantage underpriced.
- **Position Size:** $15
- **Confidence:** 5/10
- **Rationale:** 17¢ implies ~17% win probability. North London derbies are typically tight regardless of form. Arsenal may be overvalued at 62¢ given derby volatility.

#### 3. S&P 500 Year-End 2026 - Far Out-of-Money Brackets
- **Market:** S&P close price end of 2026
- **Type:** Multi-bracket range
- **Observation:** 7400-7599 bracket at 7.25x13%; 7600-7799 at 7.85x12%
- **Potential Penny Opportunities:** Lower brackets (<7000) or upper brackets (>8000) likely priced at 1¢-5¢
- **Settlement:** December 31, 2026 (~300 days)
- **Rationale:** Current SPY at $689 implies ~6890 S&P. Extreme upside/downside brackets offer lottery ticket value. If bear market emerges or AI bubble accelerates, extreme brackets could re-rate.
- **Recommended:** Check pricing on S&P <6500 or >8000 brackets for penny opportunities
- **Position Size:** $10-15 per bracket
- **Confidence:** 4/10 (high uncertainty, lottery ticket)
