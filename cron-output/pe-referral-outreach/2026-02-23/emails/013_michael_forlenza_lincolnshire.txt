Subject: Off-market opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi Michael,

I came across your profile and see Lincolnshire Management is actively acquiring lower middle market businesses across multiple sectors.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities - businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces.

**What I offer:**
- Direct relationships with business owners
- Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
- No broker intermediaries = better economics for everyone
- Focus on lower middle market businesses, $3-5M EBITDA range

**Recent example:**
- Manufacturing business in Northeast US
- $3.5M EBITDA, 18 years in operation
- Owner retiring, no broker involved
- Direct introduction to qualified buyer, LOI signed within 30 days

The buyer was thrilled to avoid the competitive auction process and get exclusive access.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (5% of transaction value up to $1M, sliding scale above).

Given Lincolnshire's track record in the lower middle market, I'd value understanding your investment criteria.

Worth a brief 15-minute call?

Best regards,
Zane

P.S. I can share my current pipeline of 10+ active lower middle market opportunities if helpful.
