Subject: Off-market HVAC opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi Mark,

I came across your profile and see 4Front Capital Partners is actively acquiring HVAC and mechanical services businesses in the Canadian lower middle market.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities - businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces.

**What I offer:**
- Direct relationships with HVAC business owners
- Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
- No broker intermediaries = better economics for everyone
- Focus on HVAC/mechanical services, $3-5M EBITDA range

**Recent example:**
- HVAC business in Ontario
- $3.2M EBITDA, 22 years in operation
- Owner retiring, no broker involved
- Direct introduction to qualified buyer, LOI signed within 30 days

The buyer was thrilled to avoid the competitive auction process and get exclusive access.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (5% of transaction value up to $1M, sliding scale above).

Worth a brief 15-minute call?

Best regards,
Zane

P.S. I can share my current pipeline of 5+ active HVAC opportunities if helpful.
