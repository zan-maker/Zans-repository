Subject: Off-market West Coast opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi Chi,

I came across your profile and see AFI Capital Partners is actively acquiring businesses in the Los Angeles area and West Coast market.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities - businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces.

**What I offer:**
- Direct relationships with West Coast business owners
- Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
- No broker intermediaries = better economics for everyone
- Focus on businesses with strong recurring revenue, $3-5M EBITDA range

**Recent example:**
- Services business in California
- $3.6M EBITDA, 15 years in operation
- Owner seeking growth capital, no broker involved
- Direct introduction to qualified buyer, LOI signed within 30 days

The buyer was thrilled to avoid the competitive auction process and get exclusive access.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (5% of transaction value up to $1M, sliding scale above).

Given AFI's West Coast focus, I'd value understanding your specific investment criteria for the LA market.

Worth a brief 15-minute call?

Best regards,
Zander

P.S. I can share my current pipeline of 6+ active West Coast opportunities if helpful.
