Subject: Off-market Texas opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi Nico,

I came across your profile and see AFI Capital Partners is actively acquiring businesses in the Austin area and Texas market.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities - businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces.

**What I offer:**
- Direct relationships with Texas business owners
- Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
- No broker intermediaries = better economics for everyone
- Focus on businesses with strong recurring revenue, $3-5M EBITDA range

**Recent example:**
- Services business in Texas
- $3.6M EBITDA, 15 years in operation
- Owner seeking growth capital, no broker involved
- Direct introduction to qualified buyer, LOI signed within 30 days

The buyer was thrilled to avoid the competitive auction process and get exclusive access.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (5% of transaction value up to $1M, sliding scale above).

Given AFI's focus on Texas, I'd value understanding your specific investment criteria for the Austin market.

Worth a brief 15-minute call?

Best regards,
Zander

P.S. I can share my current pipeline of 5+ active Texas opportunities if helpful.
