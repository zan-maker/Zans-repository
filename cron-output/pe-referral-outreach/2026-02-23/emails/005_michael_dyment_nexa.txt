Subject: Off-market A&D opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi Michael,

I came across your profile and see NEXA Capital Partners is actively acquiring aerospace and defense businesses with a focus on the Washington DC area.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities - businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces.

**What I offer:**
- Direct relationships with A&D business owners
- Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
- No broker intermediaries = better economics for everyone
- Focus on aerospace & defense contractors, $3-5M EBITDA range

**Recent example:**
- Aerospace components business in Southeast US
- $3.5M EBITDA, 25 years in operation
- Owner retiring, no broker involved
- Direct introduction to qualified buyer, LOI signed within 30 days

The buyer was thrilled to avoid the competitive auction process and get exclusive access.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (5% of transaction value up to $1M, sliding scale above).

Given your background and expertise in the aerospace sector, I'd value your insights on what would make NEXA's ideal deal profile.

Worth a brief 15-minute call?

Best regards,
Zane

P.S. I can share my current pipeline of 4+ active A&D opportunities if helpful.
