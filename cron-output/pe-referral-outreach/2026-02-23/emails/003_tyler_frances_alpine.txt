Subject: Off-market services opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi Tyler,

I came across your profile and see Alpine Investors is actively acquiring services, software, and healthcare businesses with a focus on founder-led companies.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities - businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces.

**What I offer:**
- Direct relationships with business owners
- Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
- No broker intermediaries = better economics for everyone
- Focus on services/software/healthcare, $3-5M EBITDA range

**Recent example:**
- Services business in Southeast US
- $3.8M EBITDA, 18 years in operation
- Founder seeking growth capital, no broker involved
- Direct introduction to qualified buyer, LOI signed within 30 days

The buyer was thrilled to avoid the competitive auction process and get exclusive access.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (5% of transaction value up to $1M, sliding scale above).

Worth a brief 15-minute call?

Best regards,
Zander

P.S. I can share my current pipeline of 8+ active services opportunities if helpful.
