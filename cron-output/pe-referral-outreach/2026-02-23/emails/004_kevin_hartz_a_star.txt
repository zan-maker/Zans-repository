Subject: Off-market tech opportunities - Referral partnership

Hi Kevin,

I came across your profile and see A* Capital is actively investing in technology companies in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.

I specialize in sourcing off-market opportunities - businesses that haven't listed with brokers and aren't on the major marketplaces.

**What I offer:**
- Direct relationships with technology business owners
- Pre-qualified sellers (motivated, realistic expectations)
- No broker intermediaries = better economics for everyone
- Focus on technology-enabled services, $3-5M EBITDA range

**Recent example:**
- Technology-enabled services business in California
- $4.2M EBITDA, 12 years in operation
- Founder exploring strategic options, no broker involved
- Direct introduction to qualified buyer, LOI signed within 30 days

The buyer was thrilled to avoid the competitive auction process and get exclusive access.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss a referral partnership where I bring you qualified off-market deals in exchange for a standard referral fee (5% of transaction value up to $1M, sliding scale above).

Worth a brief 15-minute call?

Best regards,
Zander

P.S. I can share my current pipeline of 6+ active technology opportunities if helpful.
